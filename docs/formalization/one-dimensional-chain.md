# One-dimensional area law and matrix product state approximation

This document records the Lean statements of the one-dimensional specialization
of the September 24, 2026 manuscripts *A two-dimensional area law from a global
spectral gap* and *Polynomial PEPS approximation of gapped square-grid ground
states*, following the repository note
[`docs/notes/one_dimensional_note`](../notes/one_dimensional_note/one_dimensional_area_law_and_mps.tex)
(Theorems A and B there). The modules live in `TNLean/MPS/AreaLaw/` and
the blueprint chapter is `blueprint/src/chapter/ch35_one_dimensional_chain.tex`.

The model is stated natively on the chain of `L` sites (`Fin L`), with local
dimension `q`, supports of range `R` (nonempty sets of sites of diameter at most
`R`), one Hermitian term of norm at most `J` per support acting as the identity
off its support, and a gapped ground vector in the sense of
`Matrix.IsGappedGroundState`. Regional entropies are QICLean's
`Entropy.regionEntropy`. Nothing is derived from the two-dimensional lattice
development of `TNLean/PEPS/AreaLaw/`; the two finite-dimensional cores (the
marginal tail bound `Entropy.surprisalTail_cut_le` and the buffered discount
`Entropy.two_mul_condEntropy_le`) are QICLean lemmas stated on an arbitrary
finite set of sites, instantiated here on the chain.

## Statements

| Note statement | Formal statement | Status |
|---|---|---|
| Setting: the chain of `L` sites, intervals, supports, Hamiltonians (`eq:ham`, `eq:gap`) | `MPS.AreaLaw.interval`, `MPS.AreaLaw.IsChainSupport`, `MPS.AreaLaw.ChainHamiltonian`, `Matrix.IsGappedGroundState` | Definitions. |
| Lemma 3.1 (marginal tail bound) at a cut | `MPS.AreaLaw.ChainHamiltonian.surprisalTail_regionState_le` with the budget `MPS.AreaLaw.cutLogBudget` | Proved, from the QICLean core. |
| `eq:count`, `eq:BR`: split interactions and cut budget of an interval | `MPS.AreaLaw.card_crossingTerms_interval_le` (`N_R = 2·2^{2R}`), `MPS.AreaLaw.cutLogBudget_interval_le` (`B_R = 1 + N_R log²(e q^{R+1})`) | Proved; the constants are those of the note. |
| Lemma 4.2 (buffered discount) | `MPS.AreaLaw.two_mul_condEntropy_interval_le`, with `MPS.AreaLaw.chainShellCount` (`m`) and `MPS.AreaLaw.chainDiscountConst` | Proved. Shells of width `R` as in the note; energy threshold `Δ/2` in place of the note's `Δ/4`, overlap losses `m log 2` in place of the note's `2 C_E/Δ`, and the shell count omits the note's fourth entry `4096 e (1 + ϑ) B_R`, the term `4096 e ϑ B_R / m` staying explicit in the discount: `docs/paper-gaps/tnlean_one_dimensional_discount_constants.tex`. |
| Araki–Lieb closure, reductions (Section 2) | `MPS.AreaLaw.regionEntropy_le_union_add`, `MPS.AreaLaw.regionEntropy_le_mul_card_boundaryEdges_of_intervals` | Proved. |
| Theorem A for intervals | `MPS.AreaLaw.regionEntropy_interval_le` with the explicit `MPS.AreaLaw.chainIntervalEntropyBound` | Proved; no existential constant. |
| Theorem A, constant linear in `1 + J/Δ` | `MPS.AreaLaw.chainIntervalEntropyBound_le`, `MPS.AreaLaw.chainAreaLawConst` | Proved. |
| Theorem A for subsets | `MPS.AreaLaw.regionEntropy_le_mul_card_boundaryEdges`, `MPS.AreaLaw.chainAreaLaw` | Proved on the chain of `L` sites (connected domains). The component reduction of the note to disconnected finite subsets of the integers is not formalized: `docs/paper-gaps/tnlean_one_dimensional_connected_domain_scope.tex`. |
| Matrix product states, cut matrices | `MPS.AreaLaw.IsOpenMPS`, `MPS.AreaLaw.cutMatrix` | Definitions. |
| Cut ranks bound the bond dimension | `MPS.AreaLaw.isOpenMPS_of_cutMatrix_rank_le` | Proved. |
| Proposition 7.1 (sequential truncation) | `MPS.AreaLaw.exists_sequentialTruncation` | Threshold form proved: the projectors onto the eigenvalues at least `exp(-(S_k + w))` at a common slack `w`, with cut ranks at most `max 1 (exp(S_k + w))` and error `∑_k √tail_k(w)`. The note's form, projecting every cut onto the `D` largest eigenvalues for an arbitrary bond dimension `D` with error `∑_k √ε_k(D)`, is not formalized; Theorem B uses only the threshold form: `docs/paper-gaps/tnlean_one_dimensional_threshold_truncation.tex`. |
| Theorem B | `MPS.AreaLaw.exists_isOpenMPS_norm_sub_le` with `MPS.AreaLaw.chainBondDimension`; polynomial form `MPS.AreaLaw.chainBondDimension_le_mul_rpow` | Proved; the bond dimension is `⌊exp(C_int + w(L))⌋ ≤ e^{C_int} (2 c₀)^{64 s} L^{128 s}` with `s = √((1 + J/Δ) B_R)`. The approximant is normalized and within `1/L` of `Ω` itself (the note allows a phase). |

The protocol route of the note (information reset, births, exchanges, the sweep
and the compression) is not formalized; Theorem B is proved by the two-line route
alone.

## Constants

Every constant is a definition of `(q, R, J, Δ)` and, for the bond dimension,
`L`; no statement carries an existential constant. In the order the proof fixes
them:

| Name | Value |
|---|---|
| `chainCrossConst R` | `N_R = 2 · 2^{2R}` |
| `chainBudgetConst q R` | `B_R = 1 + N_R log²(e q^{R+1})` |
| `chainShellCount q R J Δ` | `m = ⌈max {4, 32 N_R q^{2(R+1)} J/Δ, 128 √((1 + J/Δ) B_R)}⌉` |
| `chainDiscountConst q R J Δ` | `4096 e (J/Δ) B_R / m + m log 2` |
| `chainIntervalEntropyBound q R J Δ` | `C_int = 8 m R log q + chainDiscountConst` |
| `chainAreaLawConst q R` | `C₀ = (8 R log q + log 2)(5 + 32 N_R q^{2(R+1)} + 128 B_R) + 1024 e B_R`, with `C_int ≤ C₀ (1 + J/Δ)` |
| `chainTruncationWidth q R J Δ L` | `w = 64 √((1 + J/Δ) B_R) log(2 L² √(2 e^{e/2}))` |
| `chainBondDimension q R J Δ L` | `⌊exp(C_int + w)⌋` |

The polynomial factor `q^{2(R+1)}` in `m` is the crude bound of the formal
buffer lemma; Remark 6.3 of the note explains how it can be replaced by
`log²(e q^{R+1})` with the three-lines device, which is not carried out here.
