# Paper-Gap Notes

This directory records places where the formal development needs more detail
than the cited source paper states locally. A note should identify the exact
source passage, state the mathematical input in paper notation, and then name
the current formal boundary.

For the non-periodic MPS Fundamental Theorem route:

- `canonical_bnt_ft_theorem_surface.tex` separates paper-level theorem
  statements from auxiliary formal declarations.
- `nonperiodic_mps_bnt_comparison_inputs.tex` compares the current
  canonical-form/BNT/after-blocking proof boundary against the local paper
  sources.
- `david2006_direct_sum_input.tex` explains the older MPS representation
  paper's direct-sum input behind block-injective canonical form.
- `cpsv16_fixed_block_cancellation.tex` records the fixed-block cancellation
  step implicit in CPSV16 Theorem II.1, line 1182.
- `quantum_wielandt_deviation.tex` records the local proof boundary for the
  quantum Wielandt inequality.

Parent-Hamiltonian notes live here too, but they are not part of the current
non-periodic FT cleanup loop unless explicitly brought back into scope.
