The Lean CI build failed. Your task is to fix the build errors.

Instructions:
0. Use your judgment on whether Mathlib scouting is needed for this fix. For proof-level
   failures (sorry, tactic errors, type mismatches in proofs), read PR/issue comments for
   existing **Mathlib Scouting Reports** and use them to inform your fix. For simple failures
   (import errors, syntax issues, naming), skip scouting and fix directly.
1. Read the error logs carefully to identify the failing Lean files and error messages.
2. Common Lean build failures and how to fix them:
   - `sorry` left in proof: Fully close the lemma/theorem — replace `sorry` with a complete proof. Do NOT leave `sorry` behind or add TODO comments as a workaround.
   - Type mismatch: Check expected vs actual types and fix the proof term.
   - Unknown identifier / import error: Add the correct `import` statement.
   - Tactic failure: Try alternative tactics (`simp`, `exact`, `apply`, `omega`, etc.).
   - Timeout: Simplify the proof or break it into helper lemmas.
3. Your goal is to fully close every incomplete lemma/theorem, not just silence errors. Do not use `sorry`, `admit`, `native_decide` on non-trivial goals, or other shortcuts.
4. Run `lake build` to verify your fix compiles with zero errors and zero `sorry`s.
5. Make minimal, targeted fixes. Do not refactor unrelated code.
6. Commit and push your fix to the current branch. Prefix commit messages with `[codex-auto-fix]`.
7. After pushing, use the PR number from the runtime context to post a summary of what was fixed.

Quality bar (your fix MUST satisfy ALL of these before committing):
- Proof integrity (BLOCKER): no sorry, admit, native_decide on non-trivial goals, unsafeCast, or new axioms. See docs/PROOF_INTEGRITY.md for the full list.
- Proof correctness (BLOCKER): structured proofs, not brute-force simp/omega/ring chains. If a result looks wrong, too strong, or suspiciously general, scout Papers/ and Notes/ for the original theorems, compare hypotheses/conclusions, cite the specific paper/section.
- Mathlib style: camelCase defs, snake_case lemmas, minimal imports, no unnecessary opens, prefer `exact` over `apply` + `rfl`.
- Type safety (BLOCKER): no universe issues, missing [DecidableEq]/[Fintype] instances, or coercion-chain unification failures.
- Performance: avoid `decide` on large types, unbounded `simp` sets, deep `rw` chains, `norm_num` on symbolic expressions. Prefer `omega`, `positivity`, explicit `calc`.
- Modularity: keep new lemmas general; do not duplicate existing Mathlib results.
- Documentation: new definitions and key theorems get docstrings that explain mathematical meaning, not Lean syntax.
- Blueprint sync: when adding or completing (removing sorry from) theorems/lemmas/defs, update the corresponding blueprint/src/chapter/ entry — add `\lean{DeclarationName}` and `\leanok` tags for new results, or add `\leanok` to `\begin{proof}` for newly proven results.
If you cannot satisfy a BLOCKER category, STOP and post a PR comment explaining the obstacle instead of pushing a half-fix.
