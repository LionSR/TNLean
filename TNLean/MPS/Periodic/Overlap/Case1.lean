/-- If two periodic tensors have different periods `m_a ≠ m_b`, their overlap
decays to zero.

Source: arXiv:1708.00029, Appendix A, lines 917--950. There the different-period
decay is obtained by blocking at `p = lcm(m_a, m_b)` and using that, by
Lemma bdcf, the blocks `P_u A^{(p)}` and `Q_v B^{(p)}` are non-repeated normal
tensors, so that applying the one-site translation operator to `Q_v B^{(p)}`
versus `Q_{v+1} B^{(p)}` yields a contradiction unless the overlap vanishes.

**Route substitution (different-period decay via peripheral spectrum):** the Lean
proof realizes the *same* obstruction through the peripheral-spectrum form rather
than the paper's lcm-blocking + translation argument. If `D₁ = D₂` and
B i = ζ X (A i) X⁻¹, then
𝓔_B(Y) = ζ ζ̄ · X 𝓔_A(X⁻¹ Y X⁻ᴴ) Xᴴ. Eigenvalue uniqueness for an irreducible CP
map (Wolf, *Quantum Channels & Operations*, Thm 6.3) forces |ζ| = 1, so the
peripheral spectra of 𝓔_A and 𝓔_B agree. An `m`-periodic tensor has peripheral
spectrum {e^{2πi r/m} : 0 ≤ r < m}, so agreement forces `m_a = m_b`; hence
different periods exclude gauge-phase equivalence, and equal-or-orthogonal (the
irreducible trace-preserving overlap dichotomy) gives the decay. This is a
mathematically equivalent substitute for the paper's step, documented in
`docs/paper-gaps/1708_periodic_overlap_route_alignment.tex`. -/
