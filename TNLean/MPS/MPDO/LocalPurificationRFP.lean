# Local purification RFP condition for MPDO tensors

This file records a local tensor-level purification condition for MPDO tensors.
It is motivated by the purification tensor formula `Psipuri` in arXiv:1606.00608
(Cirac--Perez-Garcia--Schuch--Verstraete), line 747, but it is not the source
purification-RFP definition.

A tensor `M` generating MPDOs need not be a renormalization fixed point in the
transfer-map sense. Instead one writes `M` through a purifying MPS tensor `A`
whose physical leg carries a spin index together with an ancillary index, so that
`M` is the ancilla contraction of `A` with its conjugate (the `Psipuri` graphic,
line 747):

  `M^{ij} = ∑_k A^{(i,k)} ⊗ conj(A^{(j,k)})`,

and imposes the local condition that such a purification exists with `A` a
pure-state renormalization fixed point (`MPSTensor.IsRFP`, arXiv:1606.00608,
Definition 3.2).

## Scope

The predicate below is a strictly weaker local condition, not the source
purification-RFP definition. The source PRFP definition includes the global
purification equation and its trace-preserving post-ancilla structure; these are
documented in `docs/paper-gaps/cpsv16_purification_rfp_definition.tex` and
remain open. This local condition is still useful because it pins the tensor
`M^{ij}` itself, not merely the family of density operators `M` generates.

`MPOTensor.IsLocalPurificationRFP` is exactly `MPOTensor.IsLPDO` (the local
purification structure) together with the requirement that the purifying tensor,
viewed as an MPS tensor on the combined spin-ancilla index `Fin (d * dK)`, is a
pure-state RFP.

## Main definitions

* `MPOTensor.IsLocalPurificationRFP`: the local purification condition with a
  pure-state RFP purifying tensor.

## Main results

* `MPOTensor.IsLocalPurificationRFP.isLPDO`: the local condition supplies an
  LPDO witness.
* `MPOTensor.IsLocalPurificationRFP.isMPDO`: the local condition generates
  matrix product density operators.
* `MPOTensor.exists_isLocalPurificationRFP_not_isZCL`: the local condition is
  strictly weaker than the literal zero-correlation-length condition `IsZCL`,
  witnessed by a diagonal purification whose ancilla contraction halves the
  leading eigenvalue.

/-- A tensor `M` satisfies the local purification-RFP condition when it is the
ancilla contraction of a pure-state renormalization fixed point: there are a
Kraus dimension `dK`, an inner bond dimension `D'`, a purifying family
`A^{(i,k)} ∈ M_{D'}(ℂ)`, and a bond-space identification
`e : Fin D ≃ Fin D' × Fin D'`
such that

  `M^{ij} = (∑_k A^{(i,k)} ⊗ conj(A^{(j,k)})).submatrix e e`,

and the purifying tensor `A`, viewed as an MPS tensor on the combined
spin–ancilla index `Fin (d * dK)`, is a pure-state renormalization fixed point.

**Scope restriction:** This is a local tensor condition motivated by
arXiv:1606.00608, `Psipuri` (line 747), not the source PRFP definition itself.
The missing global purification and post-ancilla trace-preserving structure is

/-! ## A local purification-RFP tensor that is not ZCL

The local purification-RFP condition does not imply the literal zero-correlation
length condition `MPOTensor.IsZCL` (`E_M ∘ E_M = E_M`). The witness below is the
diagonal purification at `d = d_K = 2`, `D = D' = 1`, `A = [1/√2, 0, 0, 1/√2]`:
its purifying tensor is a pure-state renormalization fixed point, yet the ancilla
trace contraction halves the leading eigenvalue, so the induced transfer map is
`½ • id` and idempotence fails. See
`docs/paper-gaps/cpsv16_zcl_canonical_form_normalization.tex`. -/

physical-trace transfer correctly classifies the maximally mixed product state as
having zero correlation length, whereas the doubled-index condition wrongly
