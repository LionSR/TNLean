# Zero correlation length for MPO tensors

Definitions of zero-correlation-length conditions for mixed-state tensor
networks, following arXiv:1606.00608, lines 736–741.

## Main definitions

* `MPOTensor.IsZCL`: the MPO transfer map is idempotent.
* `MPOTensor.isZCL_iff_toMPSTensor_isRFP`: this condition is equivalent to the
  pure-state RFP condition for the doubled-index MPS tensor.

/-- An MPO tensor has **zero correlation length** when its transfer map is
*literally* idempotent: `E_M ∘ E_M = E_M`.

**Scope restriction (canonical form):** the source ZCL (arXiv:1606.00608,
Definition 4.2, lines 735–739, the figure `MPDO_ZCL.png`) is the natural
extension of the pure-state ZCL. The proof of the pure-state equivalence pins
that down as `𝔼² = 𝔼` **for a tensor in canonical form** (line 1248): idempotence
after the transfer operator is normalized so that its leading eigenvalue is `1`.
The literal condition here is faithful only for such normalized representatives.
For a general representative it is strictly stronger, since it forces the leading
eigenvalue to equal `1`, whereas the source ZCL is invariant under the rescaling
`E_M ↦ λ E_M`. The deviation is illustrated by the rescaled purification
`d = dK = 2`, `D = 1`, `A = [1/√2, 0, 0, 1/√2]`: it satisfies the local
purification-RFP condition, yet its transfer map is `½ • id`, so
`E_M ∘ E_M = ¼ • id ≠ E_M`; the trace contraction in the purification has dropped
the leading eigenvalue from `1` to `½`. (This counterexample is not yet
formalized.) The faithful (normalized) ZCL and the source's equivalence between
PRFP and ZCL remain open. Recorded in
`docs/paper-gaps/cpsv16_zcl_canonical_form_normalization.tex`.
