# Martingale-method spectral-gap framework for parent Hamiltonians

This file sets up the martingale approach to proving
that MPS parent Hamiltonians are gapped, following
Kastoryano–Lucia 2018 (arXiv:1705.09491), Nachtergaele 1996
(Comm. Math. Phys. 175, 565), and Fannes–Nachtergaele–Werner 1992.

## Proof route

1. **Frustration-freeness** (`parentHamiltonian_frustrationFree`): every local
   term annihilates the MPV ground state.
2. **Local projector structure** (`parentInteraction`/`localTerm`): each local
   term is an orthogonal projector on its `L`-site window.
3. **Intersection property** (`groundSpace_intersection`): for an injective
   MPS tensor, the kernel of the sum of two overlapping local terms equals
   the intersection of their kernels.
4. **Martingale operator bound**: the intersection property gives a positive
   Friedrichs angle between adjacent local ground spaces, which is the
   quantitative content of

        `h_i h_j + h_j h_i ≥ - c_{ij} (1 - γ) (h_i + h_j)`

   with constants `c_{ij}` depending only on the MPS tensor, not on `N`.
5. **Row-sum bound** `∑_{j ≠ i} c_{ij} ≤ 1`: at most `2(L-1)` local terms
   overlap a given local term.
6. **Quadratic form ⟹ norm bound**: combining the above with `h_i^2 = h_i`
   yields `H² ≥ γ H` as a quadratic form, which by the spectral theorem
   gives `γ ‖v‖ ≤ ‖H v‖` for `v ⊥ ker H`.

The last step — the implication from the quadratic-form inequality
`H² ≥ γ H` to the norm bound `γ ‖v‖ ≤ ‖H v‖` on `(ker H)ᗮ` — is packaged
as the abstract lemma `FrustrationFree.spectralGap_of_martingale` below.
Its hypothesis is the quadratic-form inequality (in inner-product form),
and its proof is the spectral-theorem argument: diagonalising the
positive symmetric operator `H` in an orthonormal eigenbasis with
nonnegative eigenvalues `μᵢ`, applying the hypothesis to each eigenvector
gives `γ μᵢ ≤ μᵢ²`, so every nonzero eigenvalue satisfies `μᵢ ≥ γ`;
expanding `v` in the basis and discarding the `ker H` components (which
vanish on `(ker H)ᗮ`) then yields `γ² ‖v‖² ≤ ‖H v‖²`.

The MPS-specific step (producing the finite-overlap estimate for
`parentHamiltonianES A L N`) is the remaining obligation of
`MPSTensor.parentHamiltonianES_gap_bound_of_friedrichs`, which packages a
concrete Friedrichs-angle/row-sum lower bound that
`MPSTensor.parentHamiltonian_gapped` turns into the existential gap statement.

## Main results

* `FrustrationFree.spectralGap_of_martingale` — abstract martingale
  criterion: the quadratic-form inequality `γ ⟨H v, v⟩ ≤ ⟨H v, H v⟩`
  for a `LinearMap.IsPositive` operator `H` implies the norm bound
  `γ ‖v‖ ≤ ‖H v‖` on `(ker H)ᗮ`.
* `MPSTensor.parentHamiltonian_gapped` — uniform spectral gap for MPS
  parent Hamiltonians on injective tensors (deferred).

/-! ### Abstract martingale criterion

The quadratic-form ⟹ norm-bound step is purely operator-theoretic and has no
MPS content in its signature, so it lives in its own `FrustrationFree`
namespace. The MPS-specific wrapper `MPSTensor.parentHamiltonian_gapped` below
instantiates it for the parent Hamiltonian. -/

**Abstract martingale criterion (quadratic form ⟹ norm bound).**

Let `H` be a positive linear operator (in the sense of `LinearMap.IsPositive`:
symmetric with `0 ≤ re ⟪H v, v⟫`) on a finite-dimensional complex Hilbert
space satisfying the quadratic-form inequality

    `γ ⟨v, H v⟩ ≤ ⟨H v, H v⟩` for all `v`,

i.e.\ `H² ≥ γ H` as a quadratic form. Then on the orthogonal complement
of `ker H`, `H` is bounded below in norm by `γ`:

    `γ ‖v‖ ≤ ‖H v‖` for all `v ⊥ ker H`.

The positivity hypothesis is essential: it rules out negative eigenvalues of
small magnitude (such as `H = -Id`, which otherwise satisfies
`γ ⟨v, H v⟩ ≤ ⟨H v, H v⟩` vacuously but fails the conclusion). For the MPS
parent Hamiltonian this hypothesis is automatic because `H = ∑ᵢ hᵢ` is a
sum of orthogonal projectors.

This is the operator-theoretic content of the Kastoryano–Lucia /
Nachtergaele martingale method: once the MPS-specific projector
geometry (Friedrichs angle on overlapping local ground spaces plus
the row-sum bound) produces the operator inequality `H² ≥ γ H` for the
PSD operator `H`, the norm lower bound — and hence the spectral gap
for eigenvectors of `H` — follows by the spectral theorem. This lemma
packages the final spectral-theorem step; the MPS-specific derivation
of the quadratic-form hypothesis is the remaining obligation inside
`MPSTensor.parentHamiltonian_gapped`. -/

**Spectral gap for MPS parent Hamiltonians.**

For an injective MPS tensor `A` and interaction range `L > 1`, there exists
a uniform gap `γ > 0` (independent of system size `N`) such that for all
`N ≥ 2L`, every vector in the orthogonal complement of the ground space
satisfies `γ * ‖v‖ ≤ ‖H_ES v‖`.

The orthogonal complement is computed in the `EuclideanSpace` structure
on `NSiteSpace d N ≃ Cfg d N → ℂ`.

**Proof strategy (Kastoryano–Lucia 2018 / Nachtergaele 1996).** The parent
Hamiltonian `H_N = ∑ᵢ hᵢ` is a frustration-free sum of local orthogonal
projectors (`parentHamiltonian_frustrationFree`). The intersection property
`groundSpace_intersection` bounds the Friedrichs angle between adjacent local
ground spaces away from zero, which provides the martingale operator
inequality

    `h_i h_j + h_j h_i ≥ - c_{ij} (1 - γ) (h_i + h_j)`

with constants `c_{ij}` depending only on the MPS tensor (not on `N`). At most
`2(L-1)` local terms overlap a given `h_i`, so the row-sum bound
`∑_{j≠i} c_{ij} ≤ 1` holds uniformly in `N`. Combined with `h_i^2 = h_i`,
this yields the quadratic-form inequality `H² ≥ γ H`, which feeds into
the abstract lemma `FrustrationFree.spectralGap_of_martingale` to produce
the norm bound `γ ‖v‖ ≤ ‖H v‖` on `(ker H)ᗮ`. The `LinearMap.IsPositive`
hypothesis required by `FrustrationFree.spectralGap_of_martingale` is
automatic here because `H_N = ∑ᵢ hᵢ` is a sum of orthogonal projectors.

The proof below invokes the MPS-specific bridge
`parentHamiltonianES_gap_bound_of_friedrichs`, whose proof is the remaining
Friedrichs-angle and row-sum obligation. -/
