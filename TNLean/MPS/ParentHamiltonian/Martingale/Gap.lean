# Uniform spectral gap for the MPS parent Hamiltonian

**Root-only.** This file contains the final spectral-gap theorems for the MPS
parent Hamiltonian. The remaining Friedrichs-angle analytic estimate is the
final missing proof obligation.

## Main results

* `parentHamiltonianES_gap_bound_of_friedrichs` — the MPS-specific
  Friedrichs-angle / row-sum estimate that supplies the remaining
  hypothesis for the reduction chain in `Martingale.Reduction`.
* `parentHamiltonian_gapped` — uniform spectral gap for MPS parent
  Hamiltonians on injective tensors, obtained from the Friedrichs-angle
  bound.

/-! ### Uniform spectral gap for the MPS parent Hamiltonian -/

-- Maintainer note: the proof of `parentHamiltonianES_gap_bound_of_friedrichs` reduces to
-- a Friedrichs-angle estimate for pairs of overlapping cyclic-window projectors with the
-- coefficient required by the finite-overlap row reduction in `Martingale.Reduction`.
/-- Friedrichs-angle and row-sum estimate for the MPS parent Hamiltonian.

This is the remaining MPS-specific martingale estimate. It asks for the explicit
uniform lower bound obtained from the Friedrichs-angle estimate for overlapping
local ground spaces, after the finite row-counting geometry has fixed the cyclic
window convention. The constant is intentionally part of this theorem statement;
the comparison with the martingale paragraph in arXiv:2011.12127, Section IV.C,
is recorded in `docs/paper-gaps/cpgsv21_martingale_overlap.tex`. -/

**Spectral gap for MPS parent Hamiltonians.**

For an injective MPS tensor `A` and interaction range `L > 1`, there exists
a uniform gap `γ > 0` (independent of system size `N`) such that for all
`N ≥ 2L`, every vector in the orthogonal complement of the ground space
satisfies `γ * ‖v‖ ≤ ‖H_ES v‖`.

The orthogonal complement is computed in the `EuclideanSpace` structure
on `NSiteSpace d N ≃ Cfg d N → ℂ`.

**Proof strategy (Kastoryano–Lucia 2018 / Nachtergaele 1996).** The parent
Hamiltonian `H_N = ∑ᵢ hᵢ` is a frustration-free sum of local orthogonal
projectors (`parentHamiltonian_frustrationFree`). The intersection property
`groundSpace_intersection` gives the local relation

    `ker h_left ∩ ker h_right ⊆ ker h`

where `h_left` and `h_right` are the two overlapping length-`L` projectors and
`h` is the length-`L+1` projector. The remaining Friedrichs-angle estimate
supplies the martingale operator inequality

    `h_i h_j + h_j h_i ≥ - c_{ij} (1 - γ) (h_i + h_j)`

with row-summable coefficients. At most `2(L-1)` local terms overlap a given
length-`L` cyclic window, so the chosen coefficients have row sum at most one.
Combined with `h_i^2 = h_i`, this yields the quadratic-form inequality
`H² ≥ γ H`, which feeds into the abstract lemma
`FrustrationFree.spectralGap_of_martingale` to produce the norm bound
`γ ‖v‖ ≤ ‖H v‖` on `(ker H)ᗮ`. The `LinearMap.IsPositive` hypothesis required
by `FrustrationFree.spectralGap_of_martingale` is automatic here because
`H_N = ∑ᵢ hᵢ` is a sum of orthogonal projectors.

The proof below invokes the MPS-specific Friedrichs-angle theorem
`parentHamiltonianES_gap_bound_of_friedrichs`, whose proof is the remaining
Friedrichs-angle and row-sum obligation. -/

      (v : EuclideanSpace ℂ (Cfg d N)),
