# Full Fundamental Theorem of MPS — Heterogeneous Equal Case

This module contains **Theorem 5**: the self-contained equal-case fundamental theorem for
heterogeneous `IsCanonicalFormBNT` families. It is the entry point that exposes the
constructions developed in three supporting sub-modules and provides the public theorem
`fundamentalTheorem_equalMPV_CFBNT_hetero`.

For Theorems 1–4 (equal-MPV FT, proportional-MPV FT, equal ⟹ proportional, power-sum
multiset equality) and combined corollaries, see
`TNLean.MPS.FundamentalTheorem.EqualProportional`.

## Main statements

### Theorem 5: Self-contained equal-case FT for heterogeneous CF-BNT
(`fundamentalTheorem_equalMPV_CFBNT_hetero`)

Given two `IsCanonicalFormBNT` families with *different* block structures
(`rA`, `rB`, `dimA`, `dimB`, `μA`, `μB`), the hypothesis `SameMPV₂` alone (no coefficient
convergence data from the caller) forces block-count equality, a block permutation, and
blockwise gauge-phase equivalence.

## Implementation notes

The proof is split across supporting sub-modules for readability:

* `TNLean.MPS.FundamentalTheorem.Full.Helpers` — small overlap / inner-product auxiliary
  lemmas and the single-block Layer-2 gauge-phase equivalence lemma.
* `TNLean.MPS.FundamentalTheorem.Full.DominantWeight` — the largest-weight norm
  comparison used by the dominant-block projection.
* `TNLean.MPS.FundamentalTheorem.Full.NondecayingOverlap` — Layer 1a,
  `exists_nondecaying_overlap_of_sameMPV₂_CFBNT`, a strong induction on `rA + rB` using a
  dominant-weight projection argument.
* `TNLean.MPS.FundamentalTheorem.Full.BlocksMatch` — Layer 1b,
  `blocks_match_of_sameMPV₂_CFBNT`, which converts the non-decaying overlap data into a
  full `BlockPermutationGaugeWitness` via the overlap dichotomy.

/-- **Self-contained equal-case Fundamental Theorem for heterogeneous CF-BNT**
([CPSV21, Corollary IV.5] / [CPSV17, Theorem 4.4 + equal-case corollary]).

Given two `IsCanonicalFormBNT` families with *different* block structures
(`rA`, `rB`, `dimA`, `dimB`, `μA`, `μB`), the hypothesis `SameMPV₂` for the assembled
block-diagonal tensors — with **no** coefficient convergence data from the caller —
forces:
1. Equal block counts: `rA = rB`.
2. A block permutation: `perm : Fin rA ≃ Fin rB`.
3. Blockwise gauge-phase equivalence: for each `j`, `dimA j = dimB (perm j)` and
   `GaugePhaseEquiv (cast … (A j)) (B (perm j))`.

Unlike `fundamentalTheorem_proportionalMPV_CFBNT`, this theorem requires **no** explicit
`aCoeff`, `bCoeff`, `aLim`, `bLim` arguments. The
coefficient convergence question that plagues the general proportional-case theorem is
bypassed entirely: the BNT decomposition identity
  `∑_j (μA j)^N * mpv(A j) σ = ∑_k (μB k)^N * mpv(B k) σ`
is analyzed directly via the overlap dichotomy (CPSV17 Appendix A), yielding per-block
gauge-phase matching.

### Proof structure

The proof delegates to `blocks_match_of_sameMPV₂_CFBNT`, which is fully proved:

- Base cases `rA = 0` or `rB = 0`: linear independence + vanishing sum → contradiction.
- Non-decaying overlap existence: `exists_nondecaying_overlap_of_sameMPV₂_CFBNT` via
  strong induction on `rA + rB` with a dominant-weight projection argument (CPSV17
  Appendix A): project onto `mpvState(B 0, N)`, derive `‖μA 0‖ = ‖μB 0‖`, match
  dominant blocks, subtract, and recurse on the tail families.
- Overlap dichotomy (dim mismatch → decay, non-GPE → decay): fully proved.
- Matching injectivity (BNT separation + GPE cross-overlap norm → 1): fully proved.
- `rA = rB` (injective maps on finite types): fully proved.
- Permutation construction and per-block data extraction: fully proved. -/
