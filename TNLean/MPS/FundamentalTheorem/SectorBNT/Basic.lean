# BNT canonical form on a `SectorDecomposition`

This module introduces the canonical-form predicate
`IsBNTCanonicalForm` over a `SectorDecomposition d`.

The structure is the minimal CPSV16/CPSV21 BNT canonical-form data on top of
a `SectorDecomposition`.  It records:

* **per-block irreducibility**, **left-canonicality**, and
  **self-overlap → 1** (non-periodic / after-blocking surface);
* **eventual linear independence** of basis MPV states (`HasBNTSectorData`);
* **block distinctness** in the cast-compatible gauge-phase shape, ruling out
  gauge-phase equivalence between distinct basis blocks of equal bond
  dimension;
* the CPSV16 §II.C line-246 **normalization convention** on the raw sector
  weights `μ_{j,q}`: `|μ_{j,q}| ≤ 1` and at least one of them equals one
  (lines 246 and 1244).

The per-block unit-modulus convention `∀ j, ∃ q, ‖μ_{j,q}‖ = 1` — implicit
in a projection-style reading of CPSV16 Appendix MPV proof, line 1182, and not
explicitly stated in CPSV16 §II.C line 246 (which is global) nor in CPSV21
Section IV.A, lines 1846–1884 (which normalizes the spectral radius of the BNT
*basis tensors*, not the copy coefficients) — is **not** a structural field of
`IsBNTCanonicalForm`.
The sector matching instead compares coefficients at a fixed sufficiently large
length by exact linear independence (`exists_block_match_exact` and its
proportional variant) together with the modulus-free `coeff_not_eventually_zero`
lemma below, so it requires no per-sector unit-modulus witness.

The structure does **not** impose an equal-modulus or strict-order
condition on the raw sector weights `P.weight j q`.  CPSV16
`eq:II_ABasicTensors` (line 286), CPSV21 Definition 4.2 (lines 1846–1850),
and the CPSV21 two-layer display (lines 1864–1884) use raw entries
`μ_{j,q}` and a coefficient `∑_q μ_{j,q}^N`; they do not require
`|μ_{j,q}|` to be constant in `q`, nor do they impose a strict order on the
moduli of distinct BNT basis elements.  The examples `C ⊕ D`,
`C ⊕ (1/2)C`, and `C ⊕ (-C) ⊕ (1/2)C` illustrate the point: each is
compatible with the line-246 normalization fields below, but none should force
an equal-modulus or strict-order structure into the core predicate.

An optional equal-modulus weight layer is provided separately as
`HasEqualModulusWeightLayer` in `SectorBNT/EqualModulus.lean`.  Some
downstream estimates may consume that layer; it is not part of the
core BNT predicate.

**BNT canonical form (core predicate `IsBNTCanonicalForm`).**

Given `P : SectorDecomposition d`, this captures the minimal CPSV16/CPSV21
BNT canonical-form data without any equal-modulus or strict-ordering
assumption on the raw sector weights.  The MPV expansion that flows from
this predicate is

```
mpv P.toTensor σ
  = ∑_j (∑_q (P.weight j q)^N) · mpv (P.basis j) σ,
```

i.e. CPSV16 §II's two-layer BNT display (lines 271–301) and CPSV21
Definition 4.2 (lines 1846–1850) together with the two-layer display
(lines 1864–1884) with **raw** `μ_{j,q}` entries and
coefficient `∑_q μ_{j,q}^N`.

The equal-modulus layer (`HasEqualModulusWeightLayer`) is therefore kept
outside this core predicate and assumed only by theorems that genuinely require
it.

/-- **Sector coefficient is not eventually zero.**

For any sector `j`, the power-sum coefficient
`P.coeff N j = ∑_q (P.weight j q)^N` is not eventually zero in `N`.  This
rules out the pathological cancellation that would obstruct the CPSV16 §II
Step 1 coefficient-comparison argument: once combined-family LI isolates
the `j`-th sector coefficient (CPSV16 lines 1121–1132), the surviving
relation cannot be `0 = 0` for large `N`, so the multiplicity-recovery
argument of CPSV16 Appendix MPV proof, lines 1184–1188, has a nonvanishing
left-hand side to compare against after the line 1182 matching step.

The proof feeds nonzero weights `P.weight j q ≠ 0` (from
`P.weight_ne_zero`) into `geom_sum_eventually_zero`
(`TNLean/MPS/FundamentalTheorem/SectorWeightComparison.lean`): if the
power-sum were eventually zero, the geometric-extrapolation lemma would
force it to vanish at every exponent including `0`, contradicting the
positivity of `P.copies j` (i.e. `∑_q 1 = P.copies j ≠ 0`).
