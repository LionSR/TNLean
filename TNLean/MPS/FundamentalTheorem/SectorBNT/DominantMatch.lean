# Single-block gauge-phase matching for BNT canonical forms

This module produces the **gauge-phase match** for a single BNT basis block of
one BNT canonical form against some block of the other, under `SameMPV₂` of
the assembled tensors.

The module has three layers:

1. **Lemma 1** — package `SameMPV₂` as a special case of
   `EventuallyNonzeroProportionalMPV₂` with constant scalar `1`.
2. **Lemma 2** — specialise the Phase 3 weak existential
   (`exists_nondecaying_overlap_pair_of_eventuallyProportional`,
   `SectorBNT/WeakExistential.lean`) to the `SameMPV₂` hypothesis: some pair
   of basis blocks has a non-decaying cross-overlap.
3. **Lemma 3** — the **block matching** statement: for any sector
   `j₀ : Fin P.basisCount`, the structural per-block unit-modulus witness
   gives a block `k₀` of `Q` of equal bond dimension, gauge-phase
   equivalent (cast-left shape) to the `P`-block at `j₀`,
   and with a non-decaying cross-overlap.

## Hypothesis structure

The block matching at a **user-supplied** sector index
`j₀ : Fin P.basisCount` (with an externally provided unit-modulus
witness) does not single out any particular sector internally: the
`IsBNTCanonicalForm` fields are deliberately invariant under
relabelling of sectors.  Following the CPSV16 §II.A line-246
normalization convention, `IsBNTCanonicalForm` carries the modulus-bound
field

* `weight_norm_le_one : ∀ j q, ‖weight j q‖ ≤ 1`  — CPSV16 line 246, the
  modulus bound.  Lemma 3 below feeds this in via `hP.weight_norm_le_one`
  and `hQ.weight_norm_le_one`.

The per-block unit-modulus convention `∀ j, ∃ q, ‖weight j q‖ = 1` is
**not** a structural field — CPSV16 line 246 is **global** (the
unit-modulus copy can sit in any sector), while CPSV21 Section IV.A,
Definition 4.2 (lines 1846–1850), defines the BNT basis, and the display at
lines 1864–1884 normalizes the spectral radius of the *basis* tensors, not
the copy
coefficients.  The matching theorem below therefore takes
the unit-modulus sector as an **explicit parameter** `j₀ : Fin P.basisCount`
together with a per-sector unit-modulus existential
`hUnitP_at_j₀ : ∃ q, ‖P.weight j₀ q‖ = 1`.  The non-decay of the matched
sector's coefficient is then derived inside the proof via
`IsBNTCanonicalForm.coeff_not_tendsto_zero_at_block`
(`SectorBNT/Api.lean`), now also taking the same per-block hypothesis.

These hypotheses are weaker than the older already-separated canonical-form
hypotheses, which combined strict weight-modulus ordering with a single
per-sector spectral-level weight. They are also weaker than the optional
`HasEqualModulusWeightLayer` layer of `SectorBNT/EqualModulus.lean`, which would
imply both bounds via the `spectral_level_dom_norm_one` +
`spectral_level_antitone` + `phase_weight` factorisation.

## Output for Phase 4b-iii

The matched gauge-phase data produced here will be consumed in Phase 4b-iii
(matched-sector subtraction) together with `SectorBNT/DropSector.lean`
(Phase 4a) and `SectorBNT/NewtonGirard.lean` (Phase 4b-i) to drive the
strong-induction step of the CPSV16 `II_cor2` argument.

`SameMPV₂` is the equal-MPV hypothesis.  By taking the proportionality scalar
to be the constant `1`, it is a degenerate special case of
`EventuallyNonzeroProportionalMPV₂` (per-`N` nonzero scalar with
eventual scope).  The conversion is purely `Filter.Eventually` packaging.

Paper anchor: CPSV16 corollary `II_cor2`, lines 1172–1192, instantiates
`thm1` with equal MPV; the proportionality scalar is `1`.

/-! ### Lemma 3: block matching at a user-supplied index `j₀`

The main result of Phase 4b-ii: under `SameMPV₂` plus a unit-modulus
witness `∃ q, ‖P.weight j₀ q‖ = 1` at a user-supplied sector index
`j₀ : Fin P.basisCount`, the block `P.basis j₀` of `P` has a `Q`-side
match `Q.basis k₀` of equal bond dimension, gauge-phase equivalent in
the cast-left shape, and with a non-decaying cross-overlap.

The proof is a direct read of the CPSV16 lines 1172–1188 unit-block
projection: assume by contradiction that **all** cross-overlaps
`mpvOverlap (P.basis j₀) (Q.basis k)` decay; project the `SameMPV₂`
identity onto `mpvState (P.basis j₀)` (taking the bilinear overlap with
the `j₀`-th `P`-block).

* The LHS = `∑_j P.coeff N j · overlap(P.basis j, P.basis j₀) N`
  is `P.coeff N j₀ + (small)` thanks to:
  – `basis_normalized_self_overlap` at `j = j₀` (`overlap → 1`);
  – `cross_overlap_basis_tendsto_zero` at `j ≠ j₀` (`overlap → 0`);
  – the structural field `weight_norm_le_one` of `IsBNTCanonicalForm`
    (CPSV16 §II.A line 246) feeds into
    `norm_coeff_le_copies_of_norm_weight_le_one` (`Api.lean`) and gives
    the coefficient bound `‖P.coeff N j‖ ≤ P.copies j`.

* The RHS = `∑_k Q.coeff N k · overlap(Q.basis k, P.basis j₀) N`
  vanishes asymptotically, again by coefficient boundedness from
  `hQ.weight_norm_le_one` and the contrapositive assumption that all
  `k`-overlaps decay.

* `SameMPV₂` makes both sides equal, so `P.coeff N j₀` tends to `0`,
  contradicting `IsBNTCanonicalForm.coeff_not_tendsto_zero_at_block`
  applied to the user-supplied unit-modulus witness `hUnit` via the
  Cesàro non-decay lemma in `SectorBNT/CesaroNonDecay.lean`.

The extracted `k₀` then satisfies (i) equal bond dimensions, via the
contrapositive of
`mpvOverlap_tendsto_zero_of_dim_ne_of_irreducible_TP`, and (ii) cast-left
gauge-phase equivalence, via the contrapositive of
`mpvOverlap_tendsto_zero_of_not_gaugePhaseEquiv_cast_left_of_irreducible_TP`.

Hypothesis disclosure: the modulus bound `weight_norm_le_one` is a
structural field of `IsBNTCanonicalForm` (CPSV16 §II.A line 246) and
need not be supplied externally.  The unit-modulus witness at the
chosen sector `j₀` is supplied externally because CPSV16 line 246 is
**global** (the unit-modulus copy can sit in any sector); the
structural field `weight_unit_exists` does not pin it to a specific
sector.  Issue #1725 Phase A retired the auxiliary dominant-block
structural field that previously fixed `j₀ = 0` and discharged the
unit-modulus witness implicitly. -/
