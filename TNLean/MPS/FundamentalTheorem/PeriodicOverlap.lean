# Periodic overlap dichotomy (Proposition 3.3, arXiv:1708.00029)

This file formalizes Proposition 3.3 of De las Cuevas–Cirac–Schuch–Perez-Garcia
(arXiv:1708.00029) and its proof from Appendix A: the "equal-or-orthogonal"
dichotomy for periodic MPS tensors.

## Main results

### Self-overlap
* `periodicSelfOverlap_tendsto` — for a periodic tensor `A` with period `m`,
  `⟨V_{mk}(A)|V_{mk}(A)⟩ → m` as `k → ∞`.

### Cross-overlap dichotomy
* `periodicOverlap_tendsto_zero_of_ne_period` — (Case 1) different periods
  imply orthogonality.
* `periodicOverlap_tendsto_zero_of_no_sector_match` — (Case 2) same period,
  same bond dimension, but no sector match implies orthogonality.
* `periodicOverlap_tendsto_zero_of_ne_dim` — different bond dimensions
  imply orthogonality (cross-transfer spectral gap).
* `periodicOverlap_gaugeEquiv_of_sector_match` — (Case 3) same period with
  a sector match forces gauge-phase equivalence `A^i = e^{iξ} U B^i U†`.

### Combined dichotomy
* `periodicOverlapDichotomy` — the full Proposition 3.3 statement.

## Proof structure (Appendix A)

**Case 1** (different periods): Block by `lcm(m_a, m_b)`. The blocked sectors
are non-repeated normal tensors by Lemma 2.4. If any sector pair matched,
translation invariance would force two non-repeated sectors of `B` to generate
equal states — contradiction.

**Case 2** (same period, no match): Block by `m`. All cross-sector overlaps
decay by the normal-tensor overlap dichotomy. The finite sum decays.

**Case 3** (same period, sector match): The hard case. From one matching pair,
propagate by translation to all sectors, define sector-restricted tensors,
establish blocked proportionality, use injectivity contraction via the
decomposition map to extract per-site proportionality, absorb phases, and
assemble the global gauge unitary.

## Status

This module is an active formalization scaffold for Proposition 3.3.
Several core theorems remain placeholders (`sorry`) and are intended to be
discharged incrementally in the order outlined in the section comments.

/-- Self-overlap of a periodic tensor: `⟨V_N(A)|V_N(A)⟩ = tr(E_A^N)`, and
since the peripheral eigenvalues are `m`-th roots of unity, each contributing 1
at multiples of `m`, the limit along `m·ℕ` equals `m`.

/-- If two periodic tensors have different periods `m_a ≠ m_b`, their overlap
decays to zero. The argument blocks by `lcm(m_a, m_b)` and uses the
non-repetition of blocked sectors to derive a contradiction if any sector pair
matched.

/-! ## Case 2: Same period, no sector match → orthogonal (Appendix A, second case) -/

/-- Two-sided sector restriction is "normal" when the original blocked tensor has
the appropriate cyclic-sector structure. This packages the consequence of
Lemma 2.4: each `P_u A^(m)` is a normal tensor.

The nontriviality hypothesis `P u ≠ 0` is required because the zero projector
would yield the zero tensor, which is not normal (it cannot be block-injective).

The completeness and orthogonality hypotheses ensure that `P` forms a genuine
cyclic-sector decomposition (resolution of the identity into pairwise orthogonal
idempotents), not merely any commuting idempotent family. Without these, the
statement would be too strong: e.g., `P u = 1` for all `u` satisfies idempotence
and commutation but does not yield a normal sector tensor in general. -/

/-- If two periodic tensors have the same period `m` but no sector pair
`(P_u A^(m), Q_v B^(m))` is gauge-phase equivalent, then their overlap
decays to zero.

The hypotheses require that `PA` and `QB` form genuine cyclic-sector
decompositions: completeness (they sum to 1), mutual orthogonality, and
commutation with the tensor (interleaving with cyclic shift). These ensure
the overlap decomposes as a sum over sector pairs.

This is the "first case" of the same-period argument in Appendix A:
block by `m`, decompose into normal sectors, and observe that all
cross-sector overlaps decay by the normal-tensor overlap dichotomy. -/

/-! ## Case 3: Same period, sector match → gauge-equivalent (Appendix A, main case) -/

/-- **Translation propagation** (Eq. A.8 / blockedABprop of arXiv:1708.00029):
Given one matching sector pair `P_ũ A^(m) ≈ e^{iλ} V Q_ṽ B^(m) V†`,
applying the translation operator `T^l` for `l = 1, …, m-1` yields
matching for all sector pairs `(u₀ + l, v₀ + l)`. Each offset `l` gets
its own gauge `U_{ṽ+l}` (the paper's Eq. blockedABprop produces a different
unitary at each sector, not a single transported gauge). The phase also
varies per `l`.

The completeness and orthogonality hypotheses ensure `PA`/`QB` form genuine
cyclic-sector decompositions (resolution of identity into pairwise orthogonal
idempotents). Without completeness, the overlap decomposition into sector
contributions is invalid (identity-resolution steps fail).

The left-canonical hypotheses (`hA_lc`, `hB_lc`) ensure the propagated phases
are unit-modulus: the transfer operator preserves the trace-preserving
condition, so the scaling factor remains on the unit circle at each step. -/

/-- **Per-site proportionality** (Eq. A.14 of arXiv:1708.00029):
After injectivity contraction, the sector-restricted tensors satisfy
`A_u^i = κ_v · e^{iη/m} · B_v^i` with `∏ κ_v = 1` and `|κ_v| = 1`.

The offset `q` accounts for the cyclic shift between sector labelings of `A`
and `B`: propagation from a match at `(u₀, v₀)` yields pairs `(u, u + q)`
where `q = v₀ - u₀`.

Each sector `u` has its own gauge `gauge u` (as produced by translation
propagation, which yields a different unitary at each sector offset). The
injectivity contraction argument then shows these per-sector gauges are
compatible and combine into a single global gauge for `RepeatedBlocks`.

The left-canonical hypotheses (`hA_lc`, `hB_lc`) are essential: they force
the gauge-proportionality phases to have unit modulus, which is required by
`RepeatedBlocks`. Without normalization, one can have `A 0 = 2 • B 0` with
phase 2, satisfying the block match but not `RepeatedBlocks`. -/

For two periodic tensors `A` and `B` with periods `m_a` and `m_b` in
irreducible form II, either their overlap decays to zero, or `D_a = D_b` and
they are related by a gauge transformation up to a unit-modulus phase (which
forces `m_a = m_b`).
