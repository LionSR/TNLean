# Periodic overlap dichotomy (Proposition 3.3, arXiv:1708.00029)

This file formalizes Proposition 3.3 of De las Cuevas–Cirac–Schuch–Perez-Garcia
(arXiv:1708.00029) and its proof from Appendix A: the "equal-or-orthogonal"
dichotomy for periodic MPS tensors.

## Main results

### Self-overlap
* `periodicSelfOverlap_tendsto` — for a periodic tensor `A` with period `m`,
  `⟨V_{mk}(A)|V_{mk}(A)⟩ → m` as `k → ∞`.

### Cross-overlap dichotomy
* `periodicOverlap_tendsto_zero_of_ne_period` — (Case 1) different periods
  imply orthogonality.
* `periodicOverlap_tendsto_zero_of_no_sector_match` — (Case 2) same period,
  same bond dimension, but no sector match implies orthogonality.
* `periodicOverlap_tendsto_zero_of_ne_dim` — different bond dimensions
  imply orthogonality (cross-transfer spectral gap).
* `periodicOverlap_gaugeEquiv_of_sector_match` — (Case 3) same period with
  a sector match forces gauge-phase equivalence `A^i = e^{iξ} U B^i U†`.

### Combined dichotomy
* `periodicOverlapDichotomy` — the full Proposition 3.3 statement.

## Proof structure (Appendix A)

**Case 1** (different periods): Block by `lcm(m_a, m_b)`. The blocked sectors
are non-repeated normal tensors by Lemma 2.4. If any sector pair matched,
translation invariance would force two non-repeated sectors of `B` to generate
equal states — contradiction.

**Case 2** (same period, no match): Block by `m`. All cross-sector overlaps
decay by the normal-tensor overlap dichotomy. The finite sum decays.

**Case 3** (same period, sector match): The hard case. From one matching pair,
propagate by translation to all sectors, define sector-restricted tensors,
establish blocked proportionality, use injectivity contraction via the
decomposition map to extract per-site proportionality, absorb phases, and
assemble the global gauge unitary.

## Status

The main theorems in this file are currently stated with `sorry` proofs.
The same-period sector statements (Case 2 and Case 3 helpers) are formulated
using **compressed sector tensors** on corner bond spaces, matching the output
of `exists_cyclic_sector_decomp_after_blocking_of_isPeriodic` and the cyclic-sector
decomposition results in `CanonicalForm/CyclicSectors.lean`.

This module records the intended mathematical statements and should not yet be
relied on as a completed formalization of Proposition 3.3.

/-- The blocks form a **cyclic sector decomposition** of `blockTensor A m`, witnessed by
orthogonal projections `P` that are fixed by the blocked adjoint transfer map and
therefore commute with every blocked letter at the **same** index:
`P k * (blockTensor A m) i = (blockTensor A m) i * P k`.

The projections arise from the peripheral spectrum of the original (unblocked)
transfer map, where they satisfy the *shifted* relation `E†(P (k+1)) = P k`.
After blocking by the period `m`, the blocked transfer map `E^m` fixes every
`P k`, so `commutes_letters_of_adjoint_fixed_projection` gives same-index
commutation with the blocked letters.

The per-sector trace relation ties each compressed block `blocks k` back to the
projection `P k` via `mpv (blocks k) σ = tr(P k · evalWord(blockTensor A m)(σ))`,
which is the defining property of `exists_compressedTensor_of_supported_projection`. -/

/-! ## Case 2: Same period, no sector match → orthogonal (Appendix A, second case) -/

/-- Case-2 helper for the compressed blocked sector tensors.

The intended mathematical content is Lemma 2.4: after blocking by the period,
each cyclic sector is a normal tensor. The statement uses the compressed sector
tensor on the corner bond space, as produced by
`exists_cyclic_sector_decomp_after_blocking_of_isPeriodic`.

The nontriviality hypothesis `dim u ≠ 0` excludes the degenerate
zero-dimensional "missing sector" case. With the current definitions, an
`MPSTensor _ 0` may satisfy block-injectivity/normality vacuously, so this
assumption is used to focus on genuine nonempty sectors.

The `hBlocks_mpv` hypothesis ties the compressed block decomposition back to
the original blocked tensor, and `hCyclic` ensures the block indexing
follows the cyclic orbit structure of the transfer map's peripheral
spectrum (see `IsCyclicSectorDecomp`). -/

/-- Same-period / no-match statement using compressed sector tensors.

If two periodic tensors have the same period `m` but no compressed sector
pair matches (up to dimension cast and gauge-phase equivalence), their
overlap decays to zero.

The `hNoMatch` hypothesis quantifies over nondegenerate dimension
equalities: for each sector pair `(u, v)` with `dimA u ≠ 0` and any
proof that `dimA u = dimB v`, the compressed blocks are not gauge-phase
equivalent. The nondegeneracy guard `dimA u ≠ 0` is essential: when
`dimA u = 0`, `GaugePhaseEquiv` may hold vacuously for
`MPSTensor _ 0`, and without this guard `hNoMatch` would be
unsatisfiable whenever a zero-dimensional sector pair exists. With
this guard, `hNoMatch` is exactly the negation of `hSomeMatch` in
`periodicOverlap_gaugeEquiv_of_sector_match`, making the two
conditions complementary for the dichotomy proof.

This is the "first case" of the same-period argument in Appendix A:
block by `m`, decompose into normal sectors, and observe that all
cross-sector overlaps decay by the normal-tensor overlap dichotomy. -/

/-! ## Case 3: Same period, sector match → gauge-equivalent (Appendix A, main case) -/

/-- **Translation propagation** (Eq. A.8 / blockedABprop of arXiv:1708.00029):
Given one matching compressed sector pair at `(u₀, v₀)`, applying the
translation operator `T^l` for `l = 1, …, m-1` yields matching for all
sector pairs `(u₀ + l, v₀ + l)`. Each offset `l` gets its own gauge
(the paper's Eq. blockedABprop produces a different unitary at each
sector, not a single transported gauge).

The `hA_cyclic`/`hB_cyclic` hypotheses (see `IsCyclicSectorDecomp`)
tie the `Fin m` block indexing to the cyclic orbit structure of the
transfer map, which is essential: without them, `SameMPV₂` alone is
permutation-invariant over blocks and would not justify the shifted
conclusion `(u₀ + l, v₀ + l)`.

The nondegeneracy hypothesis `dimA u₀ ≠ 0` ensures the initial match
is substantive: for `MPSTensor _ 0`, `GaugePhaseEquiv` holds vacuously
and propagation would produce only vacuous matches.

The left-canonical hypotheses (`hA_lc`, `hB_lc`) ensure the propagated
phases are unit-modulus: the transfer operator preserves the
trace-preserving condition, so the scaling factor remains on the unit
circle at each step. -/

/-- **Per-site proportionality** (Eq. A.14 of arXiv:1708.00029):
After injectivity contraction, the sector-restricted tensors satisfy
`A_u^i = κ_v · e^{iη/m} · B_v^i` with `∏ κ_v = 1` and `|κ_v| = 1`.

The offset `q` accounts for the cyclic shift between sector labelings of
`A` and `B`: propagation from a match at `(u₀, v₀)` yields pairs
`(u, u + q)` where `q = v₀ - u₀`.

The `hBlockMatch` hypothesis says that for every sector `u`, the
compressed blocks `blocksA u` and `blocksB (u + q)` are gauge-phase
equivalent (after dimension cast). The injectivity contraction argument
shows these per-sector gauges combine into a single global gauge for
`RepeatedBlocks`.

The nondegeneracy hypothesis `hNondeg` ensures every sector has
positive bond dimension. Without this, zero-dimensional sectors
satisfy `IsNormal`, `GaugePhaseEquiv`, and `hBlockMatch` vacuously,
which would make the conclusion `RepeatedBlocks A B` too strong.

The left-canonical hypotheses (`hA_lc`, `hB_lc`) are essential: they
force the gauge-proportionality phases to have unit modulus, which is
required by `RepeatedBlocks`. -/

/-- **Case 3: a matching sector implies gauge equivalence**. If two periodic tensors have
the same period and
a compressed sector match exists, then they are related by a gauge
transformation with a unit-modulus phase: `A^i = e^{iξ} U B^i U†`.

The hypotheses describe compressed sector decompositions: `blocksA`/`blocksB` are
the cyclic-sector tensors on corner bond spaces, tied back to the
original blocked tensors via `SameMPV₂` and to the cyclic orbit
structure via `IsCyclicSectorDecomp`. The `hSomeMatch` witness
provides a single matching sector pair `(u₀, v₀)` with compatible
dimensions and nonzero bond dimension (`dimA u₀ ≠ 0`), which excludes
the degenerate case where a zero-dimensional `GaugePhaseEquiv` holds
vacuously.

/-- **Periodic overlap dichotomy** (Proposition 3.3 of arXiv:1708.00029).

For two periodic tensors `A` and `B` with periods `m_a` and `m_b` in
irreducible form II, either their overlap decays to zero, or `D_a = D_b` and
they are related by a gauge transformation up to a unit-modulus phase (which
forces `m_a = m_b`).

This is the core technical result of the paper: all subsequent theorems
(proportional FT, equal FT with Z-gauge, symmetry corollary) depend on it. -/
