# Structural after-blocking theorem for canonical-form reduction

This file collects the final structural statements in the current
arXiv:1606.00608 reduction chain. It gives a common-period blocking theorem
for two tensors and the resulting structural after-blocking statement that both
sides admit TP-primitive decompositions.

## Main statements

* `bilateral_commonPeriod_blocking_tp_primitive_normal` — two tensors with
  primitive blocked transfer maps admit a common positive blocking period that
  preserves primitivity, left-canonical normalization, and normality.
* `fundamentalTheorem_after_blocking_1606_structural` — two tensors with the
  same MPVs admit blocked TP-primitive decompositions on both sides.

## Fundamental Theorem of MPS (arXiv:1606.00608, after blocking)

### Overview

The fundamental theorem of MPS (1606.00608 version, after blocking) asserts:

For any MPS tensor `A`, there exists a blocking period `p > 0` such that
`blockTensor A p` admits a decomposition into a trivial block plus a direct sum
of TP sectors, where each sector is left-canonical and the direct sum is
`SameMPV₂`-equivalent to the blocked tensor.

The full end-to-end statement chains:
1. Zero-block separation (`exists_irreducible_blockDecomp_liveBlocks`)
2. TP gauge (`exists_tp_gauge_from_arbitrary_with_zeroTail`)
3. Common blocking to primitive (`exists_common_blocking_all_primitive_of_TP_irr`)
4. Cyclic sector decomposition per block (`exists_cyclic_sector_decomp_after_blocking`)

### Current status

The theorem `exists_tp_sector_decomp_after_blocking` below provides:
- A blocking period `p > 0`
- A trivial block of dimension `zeroTailDim`
- A family of TP sector blocks
- The MPV relationship: `blockTensor A p` is `SameMPV₂`-equivalent to
  `zeroMPSTensor + toTensorFromBlocks μ sectors` for some weights `μ`

The full FT also requires showing each sector is:
- **Irreducible** (from `isIrreducible_restriction_of_cyclic_decomp` + orbit-sum lift)
- **Normal** (from irreducibility + primitivity of sector transfer maps)
- **Gauge-phase unique** (from the BNT permutation rigidity theorem)

These additional properties are documented but not yet fully formalized.

-- **Structural decomposition of MPS tensors after blocking (1606.00608 reduction).**
--
-- For any MPS tensor `A`, there exists a blocking period `p > 0` and a
-- decomposition of the blocked tensor into:
-- 1. A trivial block (irreducible blocks with zero spectral weight)
-- 2. A family of TP blocks with primitive transfer maps
--
-- Additionally, the weights `μ k` satisfy `μ k ≠ 0` and the full MPV
-- identity is maintained.
--
-- This is `exists_tp_primitive_blockDecomp_after_blocking` — the main reduction
-- theorem from the first section. The FT chains from this through the cyclic
-- sector decomposition to produce the final canonical form.
-- (Already proved above as `exists_tp_primitive_blockDecomp_after_blocking`.)

/-- **Bilateral common-period theorem for two tensors.**

The proof chooses a common blocking period via `lcmPeriod` (on `Fin 2`), i.e. a
common multiple of `pA` and `pB`. The theorem statement itself only asserts the
existence of some positive period `p` for which both `blockTensor A p` and
`blockTensor B p` have primitive transfer maps.

If `A` and `B` are left-canonical (TP), then TP is preserved for this common
blocking. If `A` and `B` are normal, normality is also preserved for such a
common blocking period.

This is the building block for BNT canonical form alignment in subsequent
reduction steps; see issue #672 (Gap §1 step 2a). -/

/-- **Fundamental Theorem of MPS (1606.00608, after blocking): structural version.**

For any two MPS tensors `A, B` with `SameMPV₂ A B`, after a common blocking period,
both blocked tensors admit TP-primitive decompositions. If the blocked decompositions
additionally satisfy:
- Tensor irreducibility of each block
- Distinct weight norms (pairwise)
- BNT separation (no gauge-phase equivalent pairs with same dimension)

then the block structures match up to permutation and gauge-phase equivalence.

This theorem states the structural content of arXiv:1606.00608, Theorem 1,
connecting the reduction output to the fundamental theorem conclusion. -/

### What remains for the full 1606.00608 Fundamental Theorem

The complete end-to-end FT would take two tensors `A, B` with `SameMPV₂ A B` and
produce a common blocking period `p` and matching block structures. The remaining
formalizations are:

1. **Common blocking period**: Re-block both decompositions to `p = lcm(pA, pB)`.
   This requires the relation between `blockTensor (blockTensor A pA) q`
   and `blockTensor A (pA * q)`.

2. **Sector irreducibility**: Each cyclic sector of a blocked periodic block should be
   irreducible. The orbit-sum lift hypothesis from `isIrreducible_restriction_of_cyclic_decomp`
   in `CyclicDecomposition.lean` provides this conditionally; the concrete orbit-sum
   construction from MPS Kraus operators remains to be formalized.

3. **Normal canonical form per sector**: Each irreducible TP-primitive sector becomes
   `IsNormal` via `isNormal_of_tp_primitive_irreducible` (already proved in this file).

4. **BNT separation + weight ordering + gauge-phase matching**: Apply
   `weakFundamentalTheorem_conditional` to obtain permutation and gauge-phase matching.

Steps 1–2 are the main remaining formalizations; steps 3–4 are already formalized
and just need to be combined once steps 1–2 are complete.
