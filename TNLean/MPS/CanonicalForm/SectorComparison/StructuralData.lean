# Structural after-blocking theorem for canonical-form reduction

This file collects the final structural statements in the current
canonical-form reduction following arXiv:1606.00608. It gives a common-period blocking theorem
for two tensors and the resulting structural after-blocking statement that both
sides have TP-primitive decompositions.

## Main statements

* `bilateral_commonPeriod_blocking_tp_primitive_normal` — two tensors with
  primitive blocked transfer maps have a common positive blocking period that
  preserves primitivity, left-canonical normalization, and normality.

## Canonical-form reduction after blocking

### Overview

After blocking, the canonical-form reduction writes an MPS tensor as an
all-zero summand together with a weighted direct sum of nonzero sectors:
`blockTensor A p ~ zeroMPSTensor d D₀ + toTensorFromBlocks μ sectors`, with
`p > 0`.  This is the formal counterpart of the CPSV allowance
`∑ k, D_k ≤ D`, where zero blocks may occur.

The full proof chain is:
1. Zero-block separation (`exists_irreducible_blockDecomp_nonzeroBlocks`)
2. TP gauge (`exists_tp_gauge_from_arbitrary_with_zeroTail`)
3. Common blocking to primitive (`exists_common_blocking_all_primitive_of_TP_irr`)
4. Cyclic sector decomposition per block (`exists_cyclic_sector_decomp_after_blocking`)

### Remaining mathematical assumptions

The after-blocking primitive block decomposition provides:
- A blocking period `p > 0`
- A trivial all-zero block of dimension `zeroTailDim`, representing the CPSV
  allowance `∑ k, D_k ≤ D` where zero blocks may occur
- A family of TP sector blocks
- The MPV relationship: `blockTensor A p` is `SameMPV₂`-equivalent to
  `zeroMPSTensor + toTensorFromBlocks μ sectors` for some weights `μ`

The current library already settles the common-period blocking arithmetic and
now has a one-sided phase-class BNT construction for TP primitive irreducible
nonzero-weight blocks, one-sided overlap data, and zero-tail sector comparison
from finite-length span or BNT comparison hypotheses. The theorem
`afterBlocking_perBlockCyclicDataWithZeroTail_of_sameMPV₂`
follows the CPSV order: first separate the all-zero leftover block and
TP-gauge the irreducible nonzero-weight blocks, then remove each block's period by
cyclic sectors.
It deliberately does not identify that period-removal length with the later
finite blocking length used for common refinement or injectivity.

The comparison data separated here are zero-block cancellation, finite-length
span equality, and BNT sector matching.

The common-sector theorem then rewrites the cyclic sectors at one common
physical blocking length.  The remaining assumptions are one-site injectivity
(or a blocked replacement), finite-length span equality at that length, and
the length-zero identity for the all-zero leftover block.

-- **Structural decomposition of MPS tensors after blocking (1606.00608 reduction).**
--
-- For any MPS tensor `A`, there exists a blocking period `p > 0` and a
-- decomposition of the blocked tensor into:
-- 1. A trivial block (irreducible blocks with zero spectral weight)
-- 2. A family of TP blocks with primitive transfer maps
--
-- Additionally, the weights `μ k` satisfy `μ k ≠ 0` and the full MPV
-- identity is maintained.
--
-- This is `exists_tp_primitive_blockDecomp_after_blocking` — the main reduction
-- theorem from the first section. The FT chains from this through the cyclic
-- sector decomposition to produce the final canonical form.
-- (Already proved above as `exists_tp_primitive_blockDecomp_after_blocking`.)

/-- **Bilateral common-period theorem for two tensors.**

The proof chooses a common blocking period via `lcmPeriod` (on `Fin 2`), i.e. a
common multiple of `pA` and `pB`. The theorem statement itself only asserts the
existence of some positive period `p` for which both `blockTensor A p` and
`blockTensor B p` have primitive transfer maps.

If `A` and `B` are left-canonical (TP), then TP is preserved for this common
blocking. If `A` and `B` are normal, normality is also preserved for such a
common blocking period.

This is the building block for BNT canonical form alignment in subsequent
reduction steps. -/
