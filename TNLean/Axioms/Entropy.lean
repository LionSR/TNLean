# Axiomatized entropy inequalities and equality characterizations

This module isolates the sanctioned entropy axioms so that the axiom boundary is
clear to downstream files and to CI.

## Status

* Strong subadditivity is **no longer axiomatized**: it is proved as
  `strong_subadditivity_general` in
  `TNLean.Channel.Schwarz.StrongSubadditivityPosDef`, derived from Lieb
  concavity, and applied under the name `Entropy.strongSubadditivity`.
* The Hayashi equality characterization is **split into a proved reverse
  direction and a forward-only axiom**. The reverse implication, that a
  quantum-Markov-chain state attains equality, is proved as
  `hayashi_ssa_equality_characterization_reverse` in
  `TNLean.Analysis.EntropyMarkovReverse`, from the entropy-additivity lemmas in
  `TNLean.Analysis.EntropyDecomposition`. Only the forward implication, that
  equality forces the block-diagonal structure, remains axiomatized as
  `hayashi_ssa_equality_characterization_forward`; the biconditional
  `hayashi_ssa_equality_characterization` combines the two.

## TODO

Remove the remaining axiom `hayashi_ssa_equality_characterization_forward` by
applying the formalized joint-support Koashi--Imoto block theorem to the
finite recovered conditional family and assembling those blocks into the
quantum-Markov decomposition of the tripartite state.

/-- **Forward direction of the Hayashi / Ruskai / Hayden--Jozsa--Petz--Winter
characterization of strong-subadditivity equality** (sanctioned axiom).

For a tripartite density matrix `ρ_ABC`, equality in strong subadditivity forces
`ρ_ABC` to have quantum-Markov-chain structure on the middle subsystem `B`: after
a unitary change of basis on `B`, the Hilbert space of `B` decomposes as a finite
direct sum `⊕_j (B_jᴸ ⊗ B_jᴿ)` and the state takes block-diagonal form
`⊕_j p_j (ρ_{A B_jᴸ} ⊗ ρ_{B_jᴿ C})`, recorded by the structure
`HayashiMarkovDecomposition ρ_ABC`.

This implication is the deep half of the characterization: its proof needs
recovery-map and Petz-transpose theory, that is, the analysis of when the
data-processing inequality for relative entropy is saturated and the
reconstruction of the discarded subsystem from a recovery map. The recovery
channel, finite recovered conditional family, and joint-support
Koashi--Imoto theorem are formalized; their blockwise application and the
final quantum-Markov assembly remain open. The forward direction is therefore
introduced here as a **sanctioned axiom**. The reverse direction is proved in
`TNLean.Analysis.EntropyMarkovReverse` and the biconditional below combines the
two; see `docs/paper-gaps/cpsv16_ssa_equality_hayashi_markov.tex`.

/-- **Hayashi / Ruskai / Hayden--Jozsa--Petz--Winter characterization of
strong-subadditivity equality**.

For a tripartite density matrix `ρ_ABC`, equality in strong subadditivity
holds if and only if `ρ_ABC` has quantum-Markov-chain structure on the middle
subsystem `B`: after a unitary change of basis on `B`, the Hilbert space of
`B` decomposes as a finite direct sum `⊕_j (B_jᴸ ⊗ B_jᴿ)` and the state takes
block-diagonal form `⊕_j p_j (ρ_{A B_jᴸ} ⊗ ρ_{B_jᴿ C})`, recorded by the
structure `HayashiMarkovDecomposition ρ_ABC`.

The forward implication is the sanctioned axiom
`hayashi_ssa_equality_characterization_forward`; the reverse implication is the
proved theorem `hayashi_ssa_equality_characterization_reverse` in
`TNLean.Analysis.EntropyMarkovReverse`. This biconditional combines the two, so
its only axiomatic content is the forward direction. Downstream consumers should
import the theorem statement from `TNLean/Entropy/MarkovChain.lean`, not this
axiom module.
