# Axiomatized operator convexity and concavity

This module collects the axioms for the **operator Jensen inequalities** for
matrix powers and logarithms under positive maps, and the **Lieb concavity
theorem**.

Mathlib 4.31 proves the operator concavity inputs for `x ↦ x ^ p`,
`0 ≤ p ≤ 1`, and for `log`, via `CFC.concaveOn_rpow` and
`CFC.concaveOn_log`.  It also provides the Löwner integral representation
`a ^ p = ∫ t in Ioi 0, cfcₙ (Real.rpowIntegrand₀₁ p t) a ∂μ` for
`p ∈ (0, 1)` (`CFC.exists_measure_nnrpow_eq_integral_cfcₙ_rpowIntegrand₀₁`),
together with the operator concavity of each integrand
(`CFC.concaveOn_cfc_rpowIntegrand₀₁`) and its explicit resolvent form
`cfc (Real.rpowIntegrand₀₁ p t) a = t ^ (p - 1) • 1 - t ^ p • (t • 1 + a)⁻¹`.
The axioms below remain because those inputs are not yet accompanied by a
Hansen--Pedersen / Davis--Choi operator Jensen theorem for arbitrary positive
subunital or unital maps, or by Lieb's joint concavity theorem.  Operator
convexity of `x ↦ x ^ p` for `1 ≤ p ≤ 2`, the scalar input of the convex
case, is now available as `CFC.convexOn_rpow` in
`TNLean.Analysis.RpowConvexity`.

## Axioms

The following results are standard in matrix analysis.  They are axiomatized
here because the positive-map Jensen and Lieb-concavity parts of the argument
are not yet available in Mathlib:

* `posMap_rpow_concave_jensen` — Jensen inequality for concave `rpow`.
* `posMap_rpow_convex_jensen` — Jensen inequality for convex `rpow`.
* `posMap_log_concave_jensen` — Jensen inequality for concave `log`.
* `lieb_concavity_axiom` — Lieb concavity theorem.

The trace concavity/convexity statements for `A ↦ Re Tr(A^p)` that used to
live here (`trace_rpow_concave_axiom`, `trace_rpow_convex_axiom`) have been
discharged: see `TNLean.Analysis.OperatorConvexity` for the genuine proofs
via the spectral theorem and the scalar Jensen inequality.

## Status

All four declarations remain axioms.  Mathlib 4.31 supplies the C-star
functional-calculus concavity inputs and the Löwner integral representation
for the first and third statements, but not the positive-map Jensen theorem
needed to obtain the displayed inequalities.  Earlier status notes recorded
the integral representation as missing; that is no longer accurate, and the
sole remaining obstruction for the `rpow` and `log` Jensen axioms is the
operator Jensen step itself.

The remaining Mathlib or local formalization gaps are:

* General operator Jensen inequality for positive maps (the
  Hansen--Pedersen / Davis--Choi inequality `T(f A) ≤ f(T A)` for operator
  concave `f` with `f 0 ≥ 0` and positive subunital `T`): absent from Mathlib.
  For the concave `rpow` case the per-resolvent core is already available in
  `TNLean.Channel.Schwarz.OperatorJensenAux` (`povm_resolvent_inv_le`); see the
  proof plan below.
* Monotonicity of the matrix-valued Bochner integral in the Loewner order, and
  pulling a positive linear map through that integral
  (`ContinuousLinearMap.integral_comp_comm`): the analytic ingredients of the
  integral route.  Concretely, the Loewner monotonicity step requires a closed
  positive-semidefinite cone (`OrderClosedTopology` for the Loewner order on
  matrices) together with a vector-valued `integral_mono`; neither is present in
  Mathlib 4.31 (the matrix order supplies `IsOrderedAddMonoid` and
  `StarOrderedRing`, but no `OrderClosedTopology` instance).  The
  positive-semidefinite square root needed to package each `T(P i)` as a Kraus
  term `C i * (C i)ᴴ` for `povm_resolvent_inv_le` is available as `CFC.sqrt`.
* Operator convexity of `rpow` over `[1, 2]`, the scalar input of
  `posMap_rpow_convex_jensen`, is now available as `CFC.convexOn_rpow` in
  `TNLean.Analysis.RpowConvexity`; the convex axiom therefore shares the single
  remaining positive-map Jensen obstruction with the concave one.
* Lieb concavity integral representation: absent from Mathlib.

## Proof plan

1. **Concave Jensen for `rpow`, `p ∈ [0, 1]`**: with the integral
   representation now in Mathlib, the route reduces to the per-integrand
   bound `T(cfc (rpowIntegrand₀₁ p t) A) ≤ cfc (rpowIntegrand₀₁ p t) (T A)`
   for each `t > 0`, followed by integration.  Using the resolvent form
   `cfc (rpowIntegrand₀₁ p t) a = t ^ (p - 1) • 1 - t ^ p • (t • 1 + a)⁻¹`,
   the per-integrand difference is
   `cfc (rpowIntegrand₀₁ p t) (T A) - T(cfc (rpowIntegrand₀₁ p t) A) =
     t ^ (p - 1) • (1 - T 1) + t ^ p • (T ((t • 1 + A)⁻¹) - (t • 1 + T A)⁻¹)`,
   which is positive semidefinite precisely because of the operator resolvent
   inequality `(t • 1 + T A)⁻¹ ≤ T ((t • 1 + A)⁻¹) + t⁻¹ • (1 - T 1)` for a
   positive subunital map `T`.  Diagonalizing `A = ∑ i, λ i • P i` over its
   spectral projections and setting `B i = T (P i)` (positive semidefinite,
   with `∑ i, B i = T 1 ≤ 1`), this resolvent inequality is exactly
   `povm_resolvent_inv_le` in `TNLean.Channel.Schwarz.OperatorJensenAux`, with
   the Kraus factorization `B i = (CFC.sqrt (B i)) * (CFC.sqrt (B i))ᴴ` and
   defect `(1 - ∑ i, B i)`.  What remains is integrating this pointwise bound:
   the matrix-valued Bochner monotonicity step (`integral_mono` in the Loewner
   order, needing the `OrderClosedTopology` instance flagged above) and the
   commutation of `T` with the integral.
2. **Operator convexity of `rpow` for `p ∈ [1, 2]`**: use the
   decomposition `x^p = x · x^{p-1}` for `p ∈ [1, 2]` (Mathlib's
   `rpowIntegrand₁₂`), reducing to concavity of `x^{p-1}` for
   `p - 1 ∈ [0, 1]` and the same operator Jensen step.
3. **Concave Jensen for `log`**: combine `CFC.concaveOn_log` with the
   unital operator Jensen theorem.
4. **Lieb concavity**: requires the integral representation
   `A^s B^{1-s} = (sin πs/π) ∫₀^∞ t^{s-1} A(A+tB)⁻¹ B dt` and
   resolvent monotonicity.

The single missing reusable theorem for items 1--3 is the operator Jensen
inequality for positive subunital (resp. unital) maps; once it is available,
the three `rpow`/`log` axioms collapse via the steps above.
