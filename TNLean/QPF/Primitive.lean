# Quantum Perron–Frobenius for irreducible transfer maps

This file weakens the hypothesis of the quantum Perron–Frobenius theorem from
`IsInjective A` (Kraus operators span the full algebra) to
`IsIrreducibleMap (transferMap A)` (the transfer map has no nontrivial
invariant projections).

## Main results

* `quantum_perron_frobenius_irreducible` — QPF under irreducibility of the
  transfer map (weaker than injectivity)

## Mathematical content

The standard QPF theorem in Wolf (Theorem 6.3) is stated for **irreducible**
positive maps, not specifically for injective MPS tensors. The existing
`quantum_perron_frobenius` in `Assembly.lean` uses `IsInjective A` because
that implies `IsIrreducibleMap (transferMap A)` via
`injective_implies_irreducibleCP`. This file provides the direct
irreducibility-based version.

**Hierarchy of hypotheses** (each implies the next):
  `IsInjective A` → `IsPrimitive (transferMap A)` → `IsIrreducibleMap (transferMap A)`

Note: Injectivity implies primitivity (by Wolf Corollary 6.5 / the Wielandt bound),
and primitivity (1 is the only peripheral eigenvalue) implies irreducibility.
The converse fails: an irreducible channel can have period > 1.

## Strengthening relative to the literature

The existing formalization only provides QPF at the `IsInjective` level.
This file exposes the natural generality of Wolf's theorem at the
`IsIrreducibleMap` level, which applies to tensors that are not injective
but whose transfer maps are still irreducible (e.g., after blocking).

/-- **Quantum Perron–Frobenius under irreducibility** (Wolf Theorem 6.3).

If the transfer map `E_A` is irreducible and trace-preserving (`∑ Aᵢ† Aᵢ = I`),
then it has a unique positive definite fixed point.

This is strictly more general than `quantum_perron_frobenius`, which requires
`IsInjective A`. The generalization matters for blocked tensors: after blocking
`n` sites, the resulting tensor may not be injective (the Kraus operators
may not span), but the transfer map can still be irreducible.

**Proof**: Existence of a PSD fixed point follows from the channel fixed-point
theorem. Positive definiteness follows from `posSemidef_fixedPoint_isPosDef_of_irreducible`.
Uniqueness follows from `posSemidef_fixedPoint_unique_of_irreducible`. -/
