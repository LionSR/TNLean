# The three-block resonate engine for the normal PEPS Fundamental Theorem

This file ports the edge-level resonate engine of `TNLean.PEPS.InsertionRealization`
(`resonate_middle_inverted`, `resonate_invert_right_endpoint`,
`resonate_invert_left_endpoint`, `resonate_endpoint_coeff_reconcile`) to the
**three injective region blocks** of a `NormalEdgeBlockingData`: the red region `B₁`
(one endpoint of the crossing edge `f`), the blue region `B₂` (the other endpoint),
and the complementary region `B₃` (the middle).

The source argument (arXiv:1804.04964, Section 3, Lemma `inj_isomorph`,
`eq:resonate`--`eq:O->X`, lines 355--486 of `Papers/1804.04964/paper_normal.tex`)
inserts a physical operator on a particle adjacent to the crossing edge `f`. The
state-equality `eq:resonate` is read three ways:

* inverting `B₂` and `B₃` reads the left operator off as a one-bond matrix action
  `W` on the red endpoint;
* inverting `B₁` and `B₃` reads the right operator off as a one-bond matrix action
  `V` on the blue endpoint;
* injectivity of all three blocks (and in particular the *shared* middle block
  `B₃`) forces `V = W`.

The middle block `B₃` is the new structural ingredient: it is a third, separately
invertible block disjoint from both endpoints. The two-block frame (region `R`
against its set complement `univ \ R`) cannot state the middle-strip step
(`threeBlock_middle_strip`), which strips the middle block while keeping the red
and blue endpoint residual configurations quantified independently.

## Structure

* `threeBlockComplPhysical` fuses the blue and complement physical legs into the
  single complement leg over `univ \ red` consumed by the two-block backbone
  (`regionInsertedCoeff`, `regionBlockedWeight`, the blocked left inverses).
* `threeBlockInsertedCoeff` (Target 1) is the region analogue of
  `regionInsertedCoeff` keeping the three physical legs `σred`, `σblue`, `σcompl`
  open.
* `threeBlockInsertedCoeff_eq_regionInsertedCoeff` (Target 2, the bridge) reads the
  three-block coefficient as the two-block `regionInsertedCoeff` with `R := red`,
  unlocking the entire two-block backbone.

/-! ### Fusing the blue and complement physical legs

The two-block backbone contracts the region `red` against its set complement
`univ \ red`, with a single complement physical leg `τ : RegionPhysicalConfig
(univ \ red)`. The three-block engine keeps the blue and complement legs separate.
Since `red`, `blue`, `complement` are pairwise disjoint and cover the vertex set,
every vertex outside `red` lies in `blue` or in `complement`, so the two legs fuse
into the single complement leg over `univ \ red`. -/

/-- The complement physical leg over `univ \ red`, fused from a blue physical leg
and a complement physical leg.

A vertex `w ∉ red` lies in `blue` (then read `σblue`) or, failing that, in
`complement` (then read `σcompl`); the cover and disjointness of the three blocks
make this well defined.

/-! ### The boundary edge of red carrying the inserted matrix

The crossing edge `f` of a `NormalEdgeBlockingData` has its left endpoint in the red
block and its right endpoint in the blue block (`left_mem_red`, `right_mem_blue`), so
it crosses the boundary of `red`: exactly one endpoint lies in `red`. The inserted
matrix is placed on this edge. -/

/-- The crossing edge `e` of a `NormalEdgeBlockingData` is a boundary edge of the
red block: its left endpoint lies in `red` and (since `red` and `blue` are disjoint
and its right endpoint lies in `blue`) its right endpoint does not.

/-! ### The three-block inserted coefficient

Insert a matrix `M` on the crossing edge `f` (a boundary edge of the red block) and
contract the three blocks `red`, `blue`, `complement` with three open physical legs.
The blue and complement legs are fused into the single complement leg over
`univ \ red` consumed by the two-block backbone, so the three-block coefficient is the
two-block `regionInsertedCoeff` with `R := red`. -/

/-- **The three-block inserted coefficient.** Insert `M` on the boundary edge `f` of
the red block, contract `red` on one side and the fused `blue ∪ complement` on the
other, keeping the three physical legs `σred`, `σblue`, `σcompl` open.

This is the region analogue of `regionInsertedCoeff` (`TNLean.PEPS.RegionBlock.Insertion`)
with the complement leg split along the blue/complement decomposition of `univ \ red`.

/-! ### The three blocked-tensor injectivity engines

The three blocks of a `NormalEdgeBlockingData` are each injective. Under the
concrete region-injectivity predicate `regionInjectivityDataOf A`, this means each
block is blocked-tensor injective (`RegionBlockedTensorInjective`), which is exactly
injectivity of the corresponding blocked tensor map and so supplies the chosen
left inverse `regionBlockedLeftInverse`. These are the three contraction-inverse
engines the middle-strip step (inverting the complement block `B₃`) and the two
endpoint inversions (inverting the blue block `B₂`, then the red block `B₁`) consume.

This is the region analogue of the three edge-level inverses
`edgeMiddleLeftInverse` / `localLeftInverseAt` of
`TNLean.PEPS.InsertionRealization`, now at region-block granularity. -/
