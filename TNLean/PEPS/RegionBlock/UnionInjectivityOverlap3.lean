# The overlapping union lemma: the P₀-outer bridge and the closure

This file supplies the final sub-step of the source's overlapping union-of-injective-regions
lemma of the normal PEPS Fundamental Theorem (arXiv:1804.04964, Section 3, Lemma
`injective_union`, lines 1324--1400 of `Papers/1804.04964/paper_normal.tex`) and assembles
the full overlapping union theorem `regionBlockedTensorInjective_union_overlap`.

The companions `TNLean.PEPS.RegionBlock.UnionInjectivityOverlap` and
`TNLean.PEPS.RegionBlock.UnionInjectivityOverlap2` land the two host three-block geometries
(`overlapLeftGeometry`, `overlapRightGeometry`), the first inverse application
`overlap_firstStrip`, and the rebuild step
`overlapRight_bondProd_smul_hostWeight_combination_eq_zero`.

With the four parts `P₀ = R₁ \ R₂`, `P₁ = R₁ ∩ R₂`, `P₂ = R₂ \ R₁`, both the left geometry's
complement coupling and the right geometry's complement coupling are sums of the same `P₂`
vertex product over global virtual configurations. The landed crossing collapse
(`blueRedCrossingBondProd_smul_threeBlockComplCoeff_eq`) reads each coupling, scaled by its
own positive blue/red crossing bond product, as the same family of `P₂` blocked-region
weights `regionBlockedWeight A P₂`, with an existence-indicator coefficient. The bridge matches
the two indicator coefficients: the right geometry's coupling combination, scaled and read
through the `P₂` weights, is exactly the left geometry's first-strip combination read through
the same weights, so it vanishes by `overlap_firstStrip`.

Both overlap geometries have complement block `R₂ \ R₁ = P₂`, so both complement couplings
read the same `P₂` blocked-region weights `regionBlockedWeight A (R₂ \ R₁)`. -/

/-! ### Reducing a coupling combination to the `P₂` blocked-region weights

The landed crossing collapse `blueRedCrossingBondProd_smul_threeBlockComplCoeff_eq` reads, for
either overlap geometry `g`, the positive crossing-bond multiple of the complement coupling
`threeBlockComplCoeff g hostlab σ bluelab` as a sum over complement boundary configurations
`bc'` of an existence indicator times the complement weight `regionBlockedWeight A g.complement
bc' σ`. Distributing a coefficient family over the geometry's host boundary configurations
through this collapse expresses the scaled coupling combination as an
existence-indicator-weighted combination of the complement weights. -/

/-! ### Realizability of prescribed region labels

A total virtual configuration `val` realizes, on every region `R`, the boundary label that
is the restriction of `val` to the boundary edges of `R`. Hence an existence indicator
`∃ q, lab_{R} q = bcfg ∧ …` is decided by whether the prescribed boundary labels are the
restrictions of a common `val`. Building `val` from boundary labels that agree on shared
boundary edges is the gluing the bridge needs. -/

/-! ### The `P₀`-outer edges

An edge is `P₀`-outer when it is a boundary edge of the union `R₁ ∪ R₂` but not a boundary
edge of `R₂`. Such an edge runs from the difference block `P₀ = R₁ \ R₂` to the outside
`(R₁ ∪ R₂)ᶜ`: its in-union endpoint lies in `R₁ \ R₂` (it is outside `R₂`, else the edge
would be an `R₂` boundary edge) and its other endpoint lies outside `R₁ ∪ R₂` (hence outside
`R₂`). These are the edges free in the right geometry's host `R₂` label but pinned in the
left geometry's host `R₁ ∪ R₂` label; gluing along them bridges the two host residuals. -/

/-! ### Determinacy of the `R₂` label from the overlap and difference labels

Every boundary edge of `R₂` is a boundary edge of the overlap `R₁ ∩ R₂` or of the difference
`R₂ \ R₁`: its in-`R₂` endpoint lies in exactly one of these two blocks, while its other
endpoint lies outside `R₂`, hence outside both. Therefore the `R₂` boundary label of a
configuration is determined by its overlap and difference boundary labels. -/

/-! ### The right-geometry indicator gathers the host glue

For a fixed union host label `bdry`, overlap label `β`, and difference label `bc'`, summing,
over the right geometry's host `R₂` labels `b₂`, the product of the host-glue indicator
`∃ q₁, lab_{R₁∪R₂}q₁ = bdry ∧ lab_{R₂}q₁ = b₂` with the right-geometry indicator
`∃ q₂, lab_{R₂}q₂ = b₂ ∧ lab_{R₁∩R₂}q₂ = β ∧ lab_{R₂\R₁}q₂ = bc'` reads the union-level
indicator `∃ q, lab_{R₁∪R₂}q = bdry ∧ lab_{R₁∩R₂}q = β ∧ lab_{R₂\R₁}q = bc'`.

The `R₂` label `b₂` realizing both is unique (it is determined by `β` and `bc'`), so the sum
has at most one nonzero term; the glue `p0OuterGlue` builds the union-level witness from the
two halves, and conversely the union witness realizes both halves at `b₂ = lab_{R₂}` of it. -/

The left geometry's first strip pins `R₁`, whereas the bridge needs the overlap `R₁ ∩ R₂`
pinned. An overlap-crossing edge (one endpoint in `R₁ ∩ R₂`, one in `R₁ \ R₂`, both in `R₁`)
is a boundary edge of `R₁ ∩ R₂` but not of `R₁`, `R₁ ∪ R₂`, or `R₂ \ R₁`. Gluing two
configurations along these edges bridges an `R₁` label and an `R₁ ∩ R₂` label that agree on
the shared boundary edges, the analogue of the `P₀`-outer glue for the left geometry. -/

/-! ### The `P₀`-outer bridge

The two gathering identities and the two crossing-bond reductions combine into the bridge: the
first strip's vanishing left coupling combination implies the rebuild's vanishing right
coupling combination. Both couplings reduce, via their own crossing collapse, to the same
`P₂ = R₂ \ R₁` blocked-region weights with the union-level existence indicator as coefficient;
the right indicator is gathered from the host glue, and the union indicator is then ungathered
into the left geometry's first-strip indicators, each of which vanishes by `overlap_firstStrip`.

The bridge row is `row(b₂) = ∑ bdry, c(bdry) • 1[∃ q, lab_{R₁∪R₂}q = bdry ∧ lab_{R₂}q = b₂]`. -/

/-! ### Transporting boundary configurations along a region-set equality

When two regions are equal as finite sets, their boundary configuration types coincide. The
transport equivalence `regionBoundaryConfigCongr` carries a configuration across the equality;
the boundary label of a global configuration transports the same way, so an existence
indicator over one host description is the existence indicator over the equal one. This is the
bridge between the geometry-native host `univ \ g.red` and the literal union regions. -/

/-! ### The bridge: the right coupling combination vanishes

The right coupling combination, scaled by the positive right crossing bond and read through
the crossing collapse, is the bridge-row indicator combination of the `R₂ \ R₁` weights. The
bridge coefficient identity rewrites it as the overlap-glue-weighted combination of the left
first-strip combinations, each vanishing by `overlapLeft_firstStrip_weightCombination_eq_zero`.
Dividing by the positive right crossing bond gives the rebuild hypothesis. -/

open scoped Classical in
/-- **The bridge.** From the first strip's vanishing left coupling combination, the bridge row
`overlapBridgeRow c` (carried to the right host via the transport) makes the right coupling
combination vanish for every difference physical leg and overlap boundary configuration. This
is the exact hypothesis the rebuild step
`overlapRight_bondProd_smul_hostWeight_combination_eq_zero` consumes.
