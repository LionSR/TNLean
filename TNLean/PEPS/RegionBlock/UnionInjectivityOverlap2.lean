# The overlapping union lemma: the crossing collapse and the closure

This file closes the overlapping union-of-injective-regions lemma of the normal PEPS
Fundamental Theorem (arXiv:1804.04964, Section 3, Lemma `injective_union`, lines
1324--1400 of `Papers/1804.04964/paper_normal.tex`). The companion
`TNLean.PEPS.RegionBlock.UnionInjectivityOverlap` lands the two host three-block
geometries (`overlapLeftGeometry`, `overlapRightGeometry`) and the first inverse
application `overlap_firstStrip`. This file supplies the remaining sub-step -- the
`P₁`--`P₀` crossing multiplicity collapse -- and assembles the full overlapping union
theorem `regionBlockedTensorInjective_union_overlap`.

With the four parts `P₀ = R₁ \ R₂`, `P₁ = R₁ ∩ R₂`, `P₂ = R₂ \ R₁`, the left
geometry's complement coupling `threeBlockComplCoeff` (over `overlapLeftGeometry`,
constrained by the host `R₁ ∪ R₂` label and the `R₁` boundary label) and the right
geometry's complement coupling (over `overlapRightGeometry`, constrained by the host
`R₂` label and the `P₁` boundary label) are both sums of the same `P₂` vertex product
over global virtual configurations, differing only in the boundary constraints. The
bridge re-partitioning the first by the second is the multiplicity collapse over the
`P₁`--`P₀` edges, which are free in the left coupling (both endpoints in `R₁`, neither
a host nor an `R₁` boundary edge) but pinned by the `R₂` host constraint of the right
geometry.

The key set-theoretic fact making the landed collapse machinery reusable is that, in
the right geometry, `P₀ = R₁ \ R₂` lies entirely inside the red block `R₂ᶜ`, so every
`P₁`--`P₀` edge is a blue/red crossing edge of `overlapRightGeometry`. The landed
`blueRedCrossingBondProd_smul_threeBlockComplCoeff_eq` over the right geometry then
collapses the right coupling onto the `P₂` blocked-region weights; combined with the
right geometry's blue-side factorization, this rebuilds the `R₂` blocked weights, and
the left inverse for `R₂` forces the reconstructed host residual coefficients to
vanish.

/-! ### `P₀ ⊆ R₂ᶜ`: the right geometry red block contains the difference block

In the right geometry `overlapRightGeometry R₁ R₂` the red block is `R₂ᶜ`, the blue
block is the overlap `R₁ ∩ R₂`, and the complement block is `R₂ \ R₁`. The difference
block `P₀ = R₁ \ R₂` lies inside `R₂ᶜ = red`, so every internal `P₁`--`P₀` edge has one
endpoint in the blue block and one in the red block: it is a blue/red crossing edge of
the right geometry. -/

/-! ### The right geometry blue-side host-weight collapse

The right geometry `g := overlapRightGeometry R₁ R₂` has host `univ \ g.red = R₂`, blue
block `R₁ ∩ R₂`, and complement block `R₂ \ R₁`. The blue-side factorization
`regionInteriorBondProd_smul_geometryBlueWeight_eq` over `g` expresses the positive
overlap-interior-bond multiple of the host weight, read as a function of the overlap leg,
as the overlap-coupling combination of the overlap blocked weights.

The closure feeds this factorization a coefficient row over host boundary configurations
whose right-coupling combination vanishes for every difference leg and overlap boundary
configuration; the factorization then produces a vanishing host-weight combination, read
through the fused overlap/difference leg. -/

/-- **The right blue-side host-weight collapse.** For a coefficient row over the right
geometry's host boundary configurations whose right-coupling combination
`∑ bdry₂, row bdry₂ • threeBlockComplCoeff(bdry₂, σcompl, bβ)` vanishes for every
difference leg `σcompl` and overlap boundary configuration `bβ`, the row's combination of
the host weights, scaled by the positive overlap interior bond product and read through
any fused overlap/difference leg, vanishes.

The right geometry's blue-side factorization rewrites the scaled host weight as the
overlap-coupling combination of the overlap blocked weights; distributing the row
coefficients through and applying the vanishing coupling combination to each overlap
boundary configuration leaves zero.

/-! ### The `P₁`--`P₀` crossing edges

The internal `P₁`--`P₀` edges -- edges with one endpoint in the overlap `R₁ ∩ R₂` and
one in the difference `R₁ \ R₂`, hence both endpoints in `R₁` -- are the edges that are
free in the left geometry's coupling (both endpoints in the left blue block `R₁`, so the
edge is neither a host `R₁ ∪ R₂` boundary edge nor an `R₁` boundary edge) but pinned by
the right geometry's host `R₂` boundary (`P₁ ⊆ R₂`, `P₀ ∩ R₂ = ∅`). They are exactly the
`R₂` boundary edges with both endpoints in `R₁`.

In the right geometry these are blue/red crossing edges: the overlap `P₁` is the blue
block, and `P₀ = R₁ \ R₂` lies inside the red block `R₂ᶜ`
(`overlapRightGeometry_sdiff_subset_red`). -/
