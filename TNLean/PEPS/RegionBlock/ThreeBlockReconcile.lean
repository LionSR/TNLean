# Three-block resonate engine: the V=W reconcile

This file completes `TNLean.PEPS.RegionBlock.ThreeBlockResonate2` with the **V=W
reconcile** of the three-block resonate engine for the normal PEPS Fundamental
Theorem (arXiv:1804.04964, Section 3, Lemma `inj_isomorph`). The previous two files
landed:

* the core region-blocking associativity factorization and the **middle strip**
  `threeBlock_middle_strip` (stripping the complement block while keeping the red
  and blue residual configurations independent);
* the **blue endpoint inversion** `threeBlock_invert_blue` (reading off the
  complement coupling row `threeBlockComplCoeff`);
* the **red endpoint inversion** `threeBlock_invert_red` (reading off the region row
  `regionRegionRow`).

This file ports the edge-level reconcile `resonate_endpoint_coeff_reconcile`
(`TNLean.PEPS.InsertionRealization`) to the three blocks. The edge reconcile forces
the matrix read by inverting one endpoint to equal the matrix read by inverting the
other: the residual independence is forced because both inversions reference the
**same** stripped (middle-inverted) identity. Here both endpoint inversions reference
the same `threeBlockComplRow` (the complement-stripped row produced by the middle
strip), so the two read-offs are pinned to the common middle-stripped reference.

## Structure

* `threeBlock_middle_strip_descent` descends an equality of three-block inserted
  coefficients through the complement block: equal coefficients (for all three legs)
  give equal `threeBlockComplRow`s.
* `threeBlock_red_readoff_eq_of_coeff_eq` reads the red endpoint off both sides: equal
  three-block coefficients give equal region rows `regionRegionRow` at the fused
  blue/complement leg.
* `threeBlock_blue_readoff_eq_of_coeff_eq` reads the blue endpoint off both sides:
  equal complement-stripped fused host weights give equal complement coupling rows
  `threeBlockComplCoeff`.

/-! ### Step 1: descending an equality of three-block coefficients through the strip

If two matrices `M`, `M'` inserted on the crossing edge produce the same three-block
inserted coefficient at every triple of physical legs `σred`, `σblue`, `σcompl`, then
they produce the same complement-stripped row `threeBlockComplRow` at every pair of
residual legs `σred`, `σblue`. This is the structural core of the reconcile: the
complement (middle) block is inverted on the common coefficient, pinning the two rows
to the same middle-stripped reference. It is the region analogue of the
middle-inversion step of `resonate_middle_inverted`
(`TNLean.PEPS.InsertionRealization`), now applied to two coefficient families at once
rather than the resonate identity. -/

/-- **Descending a coefficient equality through the complement strip.** If two
inserted matrices give the same three-block inserted coefficient at every physical
configuration, then their complement-stripped rows `threeBlockComplRow` agree at every
pair of red and blue residual legs.

The complement interior bond multiple of each σcompl-function is the complement blocked
tensor map of `threeBlockComplRow` (`regionInteriorBondProd_smul_threeBlockInsertedCoeff_eq`),
and the complement block's chosen left inverse recovers the row
(`threeBlock_middle_strip`). Equal coefficients give equal σcompl-functions, hence equal
left-inverse read-offs, hence equal rows after dividing out the positive interior bond
product.

/-! ### Step 2: the two endpoint read-offs

Inverting the two endpoint blocks reads two row functions off the three-block
inserted coefficient. Equal three-block coefficients give equal read-offs at the
respective endpoints, the residual independence forced by the common reference.

The **red read-off** inverts the σred-function and recovers the region row
`regionRegionRow` at the fused blue/complement leg (`threeBlock_invert_red`). The
**blue read-off** inverts the σblue-function of the complement-stripped fused host
weight and recovers the complement coupling row `threeBlockComplCoeff`
(`threeBlock_invert_blue`). The two read-offs live in different index spaces — the red
row is indexed by the host residual `bdry` and reads the complement physical leg as a
free residual, the blue row is indexed by the blue boundary configuration and reads the
complement physical leg through the coupling — and the reconcile routes both through the
common complement-stripped reference. -/

/-- **The red endpoint read-off from a coefficient equality.** If two inserted matrices
give the same three-block inserted coefficient at every physical configuration, then the
red block's chosen left inverse reads off the same region row `regionRegionRow` at the
fused blue/complement physical leg.

The red left inverse of the σred-function recovers `regionRegionRow A red f M
(threeBlockComplPhysical D σblue σcompl)` (`threeBlock_invert_red`); equal σred-functions
give the same read-off.

/-- **The blue endpoint read-off as a function of the host residual.** The blue
block's chosen left inverse, applied to the σblue-function of the complement-stripped
fused host weight and scaled by the blue interior bond product, recovers the complement
coupling row `threeBlockComplCoeff` at every host residual configuration `bdry`. This
is `threeBlock_invert_blue` packaged as the residual-quantified read-off the reconcile
references. The read-off is the same for any inserted matrix: the fused host weight is
`M`-independent, so the blue endpoint reads the complement physical leg off through the
coupling alone, providing the common reference frame against which the red read-off is
reconciled.

/-! ### The fused-leg bridge to the two-block region-inserted coefficient

The fused blue/complement physical leg `threeBlockComplPhysical D σblue σcompl`
ranges over **every** complement physical leg on `univ \ red` as `σblue`, `σcompl`
vary, because `univ \ red = blue ⊔ complement` (`sdiff_red_eq_blue_union_complement`).
Splitting a complement leg `τ` along this cover and reading the two halves recovers
`τ`, so the three-block inserted coefficient quantified over the three legs `σred`,
`σblue`, `σcompl` carries exactly the same information as the two-block
`regionInsertedCoeff` of the red region quantified over `σred`, `τ`. This bridges the
three-block engine to the block-frame coefficient transfer the per-edge gauge consumes
(`exists_regionEdgeGauge_of_coeffTransfer`,
`TNLean.PEPS.RegionBlock.RegionReconcile`). -/

halves of a complement physical leg `τ` recovers `τ`. The fused leg reads a blue vertex
off the blue half and a complement vertex off the complement half; on a vertex of
`univ \ red` (which lies in `blue` or `complement`) both halves read `τ` at that vertex.

/-- **The three-block coefficient transfer is the two-block coefficient transfer

same three-block inserted coefficient at every triple of physical legs if and only if
they give the same two-block region-inserted coefficient of the red region at every
region and complement leg. The forward direction splits a complement leg along the
blue/complement cover; the reverse direction fuses the blue and complement legs through
the bridge `threeBlockInsertedCoeff_eq_regionInsertedCoeff`.

This identifies the three-block engine's resonate hypothesis with the two-block
inserted-coefficient frame `regionInsertedCoeff` of the red region, the frame the
