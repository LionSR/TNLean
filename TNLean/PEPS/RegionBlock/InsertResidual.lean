# Grouping the inserted-site blocked weight by the local configuration at `v`

The blocked-region weight of `insert v R` splits, at a fixed local configuration
`η` of the inserted site `v`, into the inserted-site tensor `A.component v η`
times the residual sum over the vertices of `R` constrained to `η` at `v` and to
`μ` on the crossing edges of `insert v R`
(arXiv:1804.04964, Section 3, proof of Theorem 3, lines 1544--1571 of
`Papers/1804.04964/paper_normal.tex`).

This file lifts the vertex-product split `prod_region_insert_split` and the
constrained-sum split `regionBlockedWeight_insert_eq_sum_split` to the
local-configuration grouping at `v`: grouping the constrained global sum by the
local virtual configuration `η` at the inserted site, the inserted-site tensor
factor `A.component v η (σ_v)` is constant on each `η`-fiber, so the blocked
weight of `insert v R` is the sum over `η` of `A.component v η (σ_v)` against the
residual region-vertex product. This is the inserted-site grouping that the
residual-multiplicity factorization rests on: it isolates `A.component v` from
the residual exactly as the route note's per-vertex relation requires.

/-- **The inserted-site blocked weight groups by the local configuration at `v`.**

The blocked weight of `insert v R` is the sum, over local virtual configurations
`η` of the inserted site `v`, of the inserted-site tensor `A.component v η` read
at `σ`'s physical leg at `v` times the residual region-vertex sum `insertResidual`
at `η`.

The inserted-site tensor factor is constant on each `η`-fiber of the constrained
global sum, so factoring it out of `regionBlockedWeight_insert_eq_sum_split` and
grouping by `η` gives the inserted-site grouping.

/-! ### The `v`-incident consistency delta

An edge incident to the inserted site `v` that crosses the boundary of `insert v R`
runs from `v` to a vertex outside `insert v R`; it is constrained both by `μ` (as a
crossing edge of `insert v R`) and by `η` (as a `v`-incident edge), so the residual
sum is empty --- hence zero --- whenever `μ` and `η` disagree on such an edge. This
is the consistency delta the inserted-site quotient carries: only the local
configurations `η` at `v` that match `μ` on the outer `v`-incident edges contribute. -/

/-- A `v`-incident edge `g` that crosses the boundary of `insert v R` is constrained
by both `μ` (its crossing-edge label) and `η` (its `v`-incident label) in the
residual filter, so if `μ` and `η` disagree on `g` the residual sum is zero. -/

/-! ### The residual is a refinement of the smaller-region blocked weight

Every global virtual configuration in the residual filter restricts to the bridge
label `boundaryLabelOfInsert μ η` on the crossing edges of `R`
(`regionBoundaryLabel_eq_boundaryLabelOfInsert`), so the residual sum is the
sub-sum of the blocked weight of `R` at the bridge label over the configurations
that additionally restrict to `μ` on the crossing edges of `insert v R` and to `η`
at `v`.  This refinement is the bond-data identity the route note records: the
residual carries the bond data of `R` constrained by the inserted site, and the
free `insert v R`-boundary and `v`-incident edges away from `R` supply the
overcounting multiplicity that is identical for `A` and the reindexed comparison
tensor. -/

/-- The residual sum is the blocked weight of `R` at the bridge label
`boundaryLabelOfInsert μ η`, restricted to the configurations restricting to `μ`
on the crossing edges of `insert v R` and to `η` at `v`.

Concretely, the residual filter refines the blocked-weight filter at the bridge
label: every residual configuration carries `R`-boundary label
`boundaryLabelOfInsert μ η` by `regionBoundaryLabel_eq_boundaryLabelOfInsert`, and
the residual product is exactly the blocked-weight summand. -/

/-! ### The inserted-site overcounting multiplicity

The blocked weight of `R` at the bridge label and the residual sum read the same
product over the vertices of `R`, which depends on a global virtual configuration
only through the `R`-incident edges (`regionProd_congr`).  They differ only in
their constraints on the `R`-incident edges' complement: the residual additionally
pins every `insert v R`-boundary edge that is not `R`-incident (to `μ`), whereas
the bridge-label blocked weight leaves those edges free.  Grouping the
blocked-weight sum by the value on those free edges, the inner sum over each value
is the residual and the summand is constant across values, so the blocked weight is
the bond-dimension product over the non-`R`-incident `insert v R`-boundary edges
times the residual.  That bond-dimension product is the inserted-site overcounting
multiplicity; being bond data alone, it is identical for `A` and for the reindexed
comparison tensor and therefore cancels in the quotient of the two region
proportionalities. -/

/-- The inserted-site overcounting multiplicity: the bond-dimension product over the
`insert v R`-boundary edges that are not incident to `R`.  These are the edges the
residual pins to `μ` but the bridge-label blocked weight of `R` leaves free; their
bond product is the factor by which the blocked weight overcounts the residual. -/
