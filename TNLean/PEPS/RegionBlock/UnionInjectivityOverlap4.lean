# The overlapping union lemma: host reconstruction and the overlap-crossing collapse

This file supplies the boundary-combinatorial building blocks of the `R₁`-boundary-parametrized
closure of the source's overlapping union-of-injective-regions lemma of the normal PEPS
Fundamental Theorem (arXiv:1804.04964, Section 3, Lemma `injective_union`, lines 1324--1400 of
`Papers/1804.04964/paper_normal.tex`).

The companions `UnionInjectivityOverlap`, `2`, and `3` land the two host three-block geometries,
the first inverse application, the rebuild step, and the `P₀`-outer bridge. The bridge
`overlap_bridge_rightCoupling_eq_zero` makes the right coupling combination of the *summed*
bridge row vanish; fed to the rebuild and inverted by injectivity of `R₂`, this pins the
coefficient family `c` only up to the `P₀`-outer freedom.

This file lands three pieces of the parametrized closure. First, host reconstruction: the host
`R₁ ∪ R₂` boundary label is determined by the pair (`R₁`-boundary, `R₂`-boundary), because every
union boundary edge is an `R₁` or an `R₂` boundary edge. Second, difference reconstruction: the
`R₂ \ R₁` boundary label is determined by the host and `R₁` boundary labels. Third, the
overlap-crossing multiplicity collapse: for a fixed open-`R₁`-legs configuration `β₁`, the joint
existence indicator over (host, `R₁`, overlap, difference) factors as the product of the
overlap-glue indicator over (`R₁`, overlap) and the left first-strip indicator over (host, `R₁`,
difference), the gluing re-contracting the overlap along the `P₁`--`P₀` crossing edges using the
shared `R₁` boundary label.

The genuine remaining step --- a rebuild whose row spans the full host boundary so that `β₁` can
be carried alongside the `R₂` boundary --- is recorded in
`docs/paper-gaps/peps_normal_ft_section3_route.tex`, obligation 1.

/-! ### The host label is determined by the `R₁` and `R₂` labels

Every boundary edge of the union `R₁ ∪ R₂` is a boundary edge of `R₁` or of `R₂`: its in-union
endpoint lies in `R₁` or in `R₂`, while its other endpoint lies outside `R₁ ∪ R₂`, hence outside
both. Therefore the union host boundary label of a configuration is determined by its `R₁` and
`R₂` boundary labels: this is the host reconstruction underlying the final extraction. -/

/-! ### The difference label is determined by the union host and `R₁` labels

Every boundary edge of the difference `R₂ \ R₁` is a boundary edge of the union `R₁ ∪ R₂` or
of `R₁`: its in-difference endpoint lies in `R₂ \ R₁`, while its other endpoint either lies
outside `R₁ ∪ R₂` (a union boundary edge) or lies in `R₁` (an `R₁` boundary edge). Therefore
the difference boundary label of a configuration is determined by its union host and `R₁`
labels: this is the difference reconstruction underlying the `R₁`-parametrized closure. -/

/-! ### The overlap-crossing glue keeps the `R₁` label

The overlap-crossing edges are not boundary edges of `R₁`
(`not_isRegionBoundaryEdge_R₁_of_overlapCrossing`), so overwriting on them leaves the `R₁`
boundary label unchanged. This is the companion of the union, overlap, and difference
transport lemmas of `interCrossGlue` already landed. -/

/-! ### The overlap-crossing multiplicity collapse identity

The source's "plug back the tensor over `A ∩ B`" move re-contracts the overlap tensor along its
`P₁`--`P₀` crossing boundary. At the level of the boundary-configuration existence indicators
parametrized by the open-`R₁`-legs configuration `β₁`, this collapse is the factorization of
the joint existence indicator
`1[∃ q : union = bdry ∧ R₁ = β₁ ∧ overlap = β ∧ difference = bc']` into the product of the
overlap-glue indicator `1[∃ q : R₁ = β₁ ∧ overlap = β]` and the left first-strip indicator
`1[∃ q : union = bdry ∧ R₁ = β₁ ∧ difference = bc']`.

The forward split is immediate (a single witness realizes both indicators). The reverse glue
re-contracts the overlap: a witness `q₃` of the overlap-glue and a witness `q₄` of the left
indicator agree on `R₁` (both carry `R₁ = β₁`), so overwriting `q₄` by `q₃` on the
overlap-crossing edges keeps `q₄`'s union, `R₁`, and difference labels (the crossing edges are
boundary edges of none of these) and installs `q₃`'s overlap label `β`. This is the
`β₁`-parametrized gathering's gluing carrying the extra `R₁`-boundary constraint. -/
