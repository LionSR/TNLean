# The bare-edge absorbed equality from an edge witness

This file converts, at a single torus edge, a conjugation-form coefficient identity into the
*bare-edge absorbed equality* against `applyGauge B X` (arXiv:1804.04964, Section 3, proof of
Theorem 3, lines 1519--1544 of `Papers/1804.04964/paper_normal.tex`):

> `edgeInsertedCoeff A e σ N = edgeInsertedCoeff (applyGauge B X) e σ (reindex N)`.

An `EdgeCoeffIdentityWitness` at `e` carries a red blocking region `R_e` whose single boundary
edge is `e` and a conjugation-form coefficient identity realized by a per-edge gauge `Z_e`.
When `X e` is the orientation-adapted absorbing gauge `absorbedBoundaryGauge B R_e ⟨e,_⟩ Z_e`,
the bare-edge absorbed equality at `e` follows from `edgeAbsorbed_of_conjIdentity`.  Because the
bare-edge identity at `e` depends only on the gauge `X e` (the open-edge gauge cancellation
`edgeInsertedCoeff_applyGauge`), the conversion at each edge is independent of the others.

The every-edge family consuming this conversion is the translation-covariant absorbed gauge
family (`exists_torusCovariantAbsorbedGaugeFamily`), built by transporting one reference witness
per orientation class; see `docs/paper-gaps/peps_normal_ft_section3_route.tex`, section
"Closure on the torus".

/-- **The bare-edge absorbed equality from a single edge witness.**

If an edge `e` of the torus carries an `EdgeCoeffIdentityWitness` with per-edge gauge `Z`, then the
bare-edge absorbed equality holds at `e` against `applyGauge B X`, provided `X e` is the
orientation-adapted absorbing gauge `absorbedBoundaryGauge B w.region ⟨e, w.isBoundary⟩ Z` and
every bond dimension of `A` is positive.

The witness's conjugation-form coefficient identity (`EdgeCoeffIdentityWitness.hidZ`) is fed to
`edgeAbsorbed_of_conjIdentity`, which converts it to the absorbed region equality and cancels the
shared positive interior multiplicity to the bare-edge identity.
