# Scalar Power-Sum Identity

This file provides **same-cardinality power-sum corollaries** used as support lemmas
for the Appendix argument of arXiv:1606.00608. It is *not* the exact statement of Lemma
`Lem:app_simple` (lines 1155–1163 of the paper), which treats two sorted families of complex
numbers with **possibly different cardinalities** and only requires equality up to
`N ≤ max{x_a, x_b}`. See the design note below for what would be needed to formalize the
precise lemma.

Given two families of `n` complex scalars whose power sums agree for `1 ≤ k ≤ n`,
Newton's identities imply their diagonal matrices have equal characteristic polynomials, and
hence the families give the same multiset of values counted with multiplicity. This is the
finite-range, same-cardinality part needed before treating the full unequal-cardinality source
statement.

## Strategy

We reduce to the already-proved `Matrix.charpoly_eq_of_forall_trace_pow_eq` from
`TNLean.Algebra.NewtonGirard` by observing that the trace of a power of a diagonal matrix equals
the corresponding power sum:

  `trace (diagonal a ^ k) = ∑ i, a i ^ k`

## Main results

* `Matrix.trace_diagonal_pow`: `trace (diagonal a ^ k) = ∑ i, a i ^ k`.

* `Matrix.sum_pow_eq_implies_charpoly_diagonal_eq_of_le_card`: If
  `∑ i, a i ^ k = ∑ i, b i ^ k` for `1 ≤ k ≤ card n`, then
  `(diagonal a).charpoly = (diagonal b).charpoly`.

* `Matrix.sum_pow_eq_implies_charpoly_diagonal_eq`: If
  `∑ i, a i ^ k = ∑ i, b i ^ k` for all `k ≥ 1`, then
  `(diagonal a).charpoly = (diagonal b).charpoly`.

* `Matrix.sum_pow_eq_implies_multiset_eq_of_le_card`: Under the finite-range
  hypothesis `1 ≤ k ≤ card n`, the multisets `Finset.univ.val.map a` and
  `Finset.univ.val.map b` are equal.

* `Matrix.sum_pow_eq_implies_multiset_eq`: Under the same hypotheses, the multisets
  `Finset.univ.val.map a` and `Finset.univ.val.map b` are equal.

## Design note: missing exact source statement

The paper's Lemma `Lem:app_simple` (arXiv:1606.00608, lines 1155–1163) states:

  Let `λ_{a,k}` (k=1,…,x_a) and `λ_{b,k}` (k=1,…,x_b) be two **sorted** finite families
  of complex numbers (sorted by nonincreasing absolute value, then nondecreasing argument).
  If `∀ N ≤ max{x_a, x_b}`,
    `∑_{k=1}^{x_a} λ_{a,k}^N = ∑_{k=1}^{x_b} λ_{b,k}^N`,
  then `x_a = x_b` and `λ_{a,k} = λ_{b,k}` for all k.

The all-positive-power theorem in this file differs in three ways:

  1. **Same cardinality**: both families share the same finite type `n` (no deduction of
     `x_a = x_b`).
  2. **Unbounded exponent range**: equality is for *all* `k > 0`, not just `k ≤ max{x_a, x_b}`.
  3. **No sorting hypothesis**: we work directly with multisets through the characteristic
     polynomial, making lexicographic-phase sorting unnecessary — the polynomial equality
     absorbs the ordering.

These relaxations suffice for the coefficient-comparison path taken in the formalized
fundamental theorems when the two families are already known to have the same length.
A full formalization of `Lem:app_simple` as written would require:
  - a "sorted complex list" type with the paper's sorting convention,
  - powers up to the larger cardinality,
  - a nonzero-entry or exponent-zero mechanism to rule out invisible zero terms,
  - a combinatorial counting-via-Vandermonde proof to conclude cardinality equality.

This is a direct corollary: equal characteristic polynomials of diagonal matrices unfold (via
`charpoly_diagonal`) to `∏ i, (X - C (a i)) = ∏ i, (X - C (b i))`, from which we extract equal
roots.  Note that this is a **same-cardinality** result; the paper's `Lem:app_simple` additionally
deduces cardinality equality when the sizes may differ. -/
