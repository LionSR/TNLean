# Semisimplicity of a finite-dimensional ⋆-subalgebra of complex matrices

A ⋆-subalgebra of the complex matrix algebra is semisimple, and over the complex
numbers it therefore decomposes as a finite product of matrix algebras
(its Wedderburn–Artin form).

This is the algebraic core of Wolf Ch. 6, towards Thm 6.14 (the structure of the
fixed-point set of a Schwarz map), supplying the semisimple-decomposition step of
that structure theory.

## Main results

* `Matrix.eq_zero_of_isNilpotent_conjTranspose_mul_self` — if the positive
  semidefinite matrix `Aᴴ * A` is nilpotent, then `A = 0`.
* `StarSubalgebra.isSemisimpleRing` — a ⋆-subalgebra of `Matrix n n ℂ` is a
  semisimple ring.
* `StarSubalgebra.exists_algEquiv_pi_matrix` — such a ⋆-subalgebra is isomorphic,
  as a `ℂ`-algebra, to a finite product of complex matrix algebras.

## Proof outline

A finite-dimensional algebra over a field is Artinian, so its Jacobson radical is
nilpotent. If `x` lies in the radical, then `x⋆ * x` lies there too (the radical
is a two-sided ideal), hence is nilpotent. In `Matrix n n ℂ` the element
`x⋆ * x = (↑x)ᴴ * ↑x` is positive semidefinite, and a nilpotent positive
semidefinite matrix vanishes (its trace is a nilpotent complex number, hence
zero, and `(Aᴴ * A).trace = 0 ↔ A = 0`). Therefore `↑x = 0`, so the radical is
trivial and the subalgebra is semisimple. Wedderburn–Artin over an algebraically
closed field then gives the product-of-matrix-algebras decomposition.

## Remaining gap towards Wolf Thm 6.14

The full theorem also asserts that the decomposition is implemented by a single
*unitary* conjugation bringing the subalgebra to block-diagonal form (each block a
full matrix algebra times the identity on a multiplicity space). That ⋆- and
unitary-upgrade of the abstract algebra isomorphism is not formalized here; it is
the remaining step towards Wolf Thm 6.14.
