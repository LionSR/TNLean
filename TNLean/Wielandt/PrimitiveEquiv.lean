# Primitive equivalences — easy directions (Proposition 3)

This file proves the **easy first directions** of Proposition 3 from
arXiv:0909.5347, which establishes equivalences between primitivity,
eventually full Kraus rank, and strong irreducibility.

## What is proved here

* `vectorSpreadSpan_eq_top_of_wordSpan_eq_top`:
  If `wordSpan A N = ⊤` (the exact word span at level N is full) and `φ ≠ 0`,
  then `vectorSpreadSpan A φ N = ⊤` (exact vector spread at level N is full).
  This is the (b)→(a) direction of Proposition 3.

* `isPrimitivePaper_of_hasEventuallyFullKrausRank`:
  Eventually full Kraus rank implies paper-primitivity.
  This is direction (b)→(a) of Proposition 3 at the predicate level.

* `qIndex_le_iIndex`:
  The primitivity index `q(E_A)` is at most the full-Kraus-rank index `i(A)`,
  provided the tensor has eventually full Kraus rank.

## The full equivalence

All three directions of Proposition 3 are now proved:

* **(b)→(a)**: Proved here (`isPrimitivePaper_of_hasEventuallyFullKrausRank`).
* **(a)→(c)**: Proved in `Prop3_ac.lean` (`isStronglyIrreduciblePaper_of_isPrimitivePaper`).
* **(c)→(b)**: Proved in `Prop3_cb.lean`
  (`hasEventuallyFullKrausRank_of_isStronglyIrreduciblePaper`).

The full circular equivalence and `Iff` statements are assembled in `Prop3.lean`.

/-! ## (b)→(a): Full word span implies full vector spread -/

/-- If `wordSpan A N = ⊤` and `φ ≠ 0`, then `vectorSpreadSpan A φ N = ⊤`.

**Proof sketch**: The map `f : M ↦ M *ᵥ φ` sends `wordSpan A N` onto
`vectorSpreadSpan A φ N` (by `map_wordSpan_eq_vectorSpreadSpan`). If
`wordSpan A N = ⊤`, then the image is `range f`. Since `φ ≠ 0`, the map
`f` is surjective: for any target vector `v`, we can build `M` with
`M *ᵥ φ = v` using `Matrix.single` basis elements.

Paper: This is implicit in Proposition 3's direction (b)⟹(a).

/-! ## (b)→(a): Eventually full Kraus rank implies paper-primitivity -/

/-- **Proposition 3, direction (b)⟹(a)**:
If `A` has eventually full Kraus rank, then `A` is primitive in the paper's sense.

This is the easy direction: if some `wordSpan A N = ⊤`, then taking `q = N`,
we have `vectorSpreadSpan A φ N = ⊤` for every nonzero `φ` by
`vectorSpreadSpan_eq_top_of_wordSpan_eq_top`.

/-- **Proposition 3, direction (b)⟹(a)**, stated with `IsNormal`:
If `A` is normal, then `A` is primitive in the paper's sense.

This is the restatement of `isPrimitivePaper_of_hasEventuallyFullKrausRank`
using the library's `IsNormal` predicate instead of
`HasEventuallyFullKrausRank`. -/

/-! ## Index bound: q(E_A) ≤ i(A) -/

/-- **q(E_A) ≤ i(A)**: the primitivity index is at most the full-Kraus-rank index,
provided the tensor has eventually full Kraus rank.

Paper: "q(E_A) ≤ i(A)" (arXiv:0909.5347, equation (2)).

The proof uses `vectorSpreadSpan_eq_top_of_wordSpan_eq_top`: since
`wordSpan A (iIndex A) = ⊤`, we have `vectorSpreadSpan A φ (iIndex A) = ⊤`
for all nonzero φ, so `qIndex A ≤ iIndex A`. -/
