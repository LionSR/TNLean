# Quantum Wielandt: primitivity implies normality under `PosDef`

This file collects results on the primitive-to-normal implication:
`isNormal_of_isPrimitiveMPS_of_posDef`, together with an exact-word-span
witness theorem that additionally requires aperiodicity.

## Proof route for normality

```
  IsPrimitiveMPS A ρ + ρ.PosDef
    → IsStronglyIrreduciblePaper A
    → HasEventuallyFullKrausRank A
    → IsNormal A
```

The `(a)→(c)` part is provided by `ImpliesStronglyIrreducible.lean`, while the
`(c)→(b)` part is provided by `Primitivity/StronglyIrreducibleToFullRank.lean`.

## Aperiodicity

The main theorem `isNormal_of_isPrimitiveMPS_of_posDef` requires only
`IsPrimitiveMPS A ρ` and `ρ.PosDef` — no aperiodicity assumption. Strong
irreducibility already yields peripheral spectrum `{1}`.

The witness theorem
`wordSpan_eq_top_eventually_of_isPrimitiveMPS_of_posDef_of_aperiodic` takes an
additional `hAper : 1 ∈ wordSpan A 1` to upgrade `IsNormal A` to monotone
exact-length word spans.

This module is intentionally auxiliary. Downstream users who only need
Proposition 3 / Theorem 1 wrappers should prefer
`Primitivity/Equivalence.lean` and `PaperResults/WielandtInequality.lean`.

/-- **Quantum Wielandt theorem.**

If `A` satisfies the spectral-gap predicate `IsPrimitiveMPS A ρ` and the fixed
point `ρ` is positive definite, then `A` is normal.

The proof factors through strong irreducibility: from `IsPrimitiveMPS + ρ.PosDef`
one gets `IsStronglyIrreduciblePaper A` (i.e., primitive in Wolf's sense), and
Wolf's primitivity equivalence (`wolf_theorem_6_8_conjunction`) identifies this
directly with eventual full Kraus rank, hence normality.

No aperiodicity hypothesis is needed. -/

/-- Under `IsPrimitiveMPS`, `PosDef`, and aperiodicity, exact word spans are eventually `⊤`.

This is the witness form of `isNormal_of_isPrimitiveMPS_of_posDef`: once
`IsNormal A` is known, the extra aperiodicity hypothesis makes exact word spans
monotone, so from one full span one gets `wordSpan A n = ⊤` for all sufficiently
large `n`. -/
