/-- **Wolf Proposition 7.5** (1 → 3): If `T_{t₀}` is irreducible for some
`t₀ > 0`, then `T_t` is primitive for all `t > 0`.

The proof has two parts:

**Part 1 — Irreducibility propagation** (`hT_irr_all`):
`T_{t₀}` irreducible → `T_s` irreducible for ALL `s > 0`.
Uses the kernel bridge: `ker(L) = Span{σ}` where `σ` is the unique
faithful density fixed point of `T_{t₀}`. Then `σ` is fixed by all `T_s`
(semigroup commutativity + density uniqueness). For each `s > 0`, `T_s`
is shown irreducible via `isIrreducibleMap_of_channel_posDef_fixedPoint_unique`.

**Part 2 — Roots of unity → primitivity**:
Given irreducibility at all times, peripheral eigenvalues are roots of unity
(Wolf Thm 6.6). If `μ` is a peripheral eigenvalue of `T_t` with `μ^p = 1`,
the eigenvector `V` is a fixed point of `T_{pt}`. By irreducibility of
`T_{pt}`, `V` must be proportional to the unique faithful density fixed
point `σ'`, giving `T_t σ' = μ σ'`. Trace preservation then forces `μ = 1`.
**This part is fully proved.** -/

/-- **Wolf Proposition 7.5** (full equivalence): For a QDS of channels, the
following are equivalent:
1. There exists `t₀ > 0` such that `T_{t₀}` is irreducible.
2. `T_t` is irreducible for all `t > 0`.
3. `T_t` is primitive for all `t > 0`.
4. There exists a positive definite `ρ_∞` such that `T_t(ρ) → ρ_∞` for all
   density matrices `ρ`.
5. `ker(L)` is one-dimensional and spanned by a positive definite `ρ_∞`.

This formalization captures the equivalence of items 1, 2, and 3:
`(∃ t₀ > 0, IsIrreducibleMap (T t₀)) ↔ (∀ t > 0, IsPrimitive (T t) ∧ IsIrreducibleMap (T t))`.

The RHS includes `IsIrreducibleMap` alongside `IsPrimitive` because the definition
`IsPrimitive E := peripheralEigenvalues E = {1}` records only the *set* of peripheral
eigenvalues, which alone does not imply irreducibility (e.g. the identity map on
`M₂(ℂ)` is primitive but not irreducible). For quantum dynamical semigroups,
irreducibility at one time propagates to all times, making the conjunction equivalent
to item 2, and `IsPrimitive` then follows as a consequence. -/
