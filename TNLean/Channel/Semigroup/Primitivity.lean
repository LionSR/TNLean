# Irreducibility implies primitivity for quantum dynamical semigroups — Prop 7.5

## Main results

* `irreducible_semigroup_implies_primitive` — **Prop 7.5**:
  If `T_{t₀} = exp(t₀ · L)` is irreducible for some `t₀ > 0`, then
  `T_t` is primitive for ALL `t > 0`.

## Proof idea

If `T_{t₀}` is irreducible, then by Wolf Thm 6.6, its peripheral eigenvalues
`{λ₁, ..., λₘ}` are roots of unity. Consider `T_{π·t₀} = exp(π·t₀·L)`.
Its peripheral eigenvalues are `{λ₁^π, ..., λₘ^π}`. For irrational `π`,
`λᵢ^π` can only be a root of unity if `λᵢ = 1`. Since `T_{π·t₀}` is also
a channel (hence has peripheral eigenvalues that are roots of unity by
Thm 6.6), this forces `m = 1`, meaning `T_{t₀}` already has trivial
peripheral spectrum, hence is primitive.

/-! ## Key lemma: exp(itθ) root of unity for all t > 0 implies θ = 0

This is the number-theoretic heart of Prop 7.5. If `exp(i t θ)` is a root of unity
for every `t > 0`, then `θ = 0`. The proof uses the density of irrationals:
`exp(i t θ)^p = 1` means `t p θ ∈ 2π ℤ`, but this cannot hold for all `t > 0`
unless `θ = 0` (since `t ↦ t θ / (2π)` takes irrational values). -/

/-- If `exp(i · t · θ)` is a root of unity for every `t > 0`, then `θ = 0`.

**Proof sketch**: For `t = 1`, `exp(iθ)^p₁ = 1` gives `p₁θ = 2πk₁` for some `k₁ ∈ ℤ`.
For `t = √2`, `exp(i√2θ)^p₂ = 1` gives `√2 p₂ θ = 2πk₂`. Dividing:
`√2 = k₂ p₁ / (k₁ p₂)`, contradicting the irrationality of `√2`. -/

/-! ## Prop 7.5: Irreducibility implies primitivity for QDS -/

/-- **Wolf Proposition 7.5** (1 → 3): If `T_{t₀}` is irreducible for some
`t₀ > 0`, then `T_t` is primitive for all `t > 0`.

The key insight is that peripheral eigenvalues of an irreducible channel
are roots of unity (Thm 6.6). Scaling time by an irrational factor shows
that the only root of unity that can survive is 1, hence the peripheral
spectrum is trivial, which is primitivity.

**Proof outline** (formalized modulo key spectral-mapping infrastructure):
1. `T_{t₀}` irreducible → peripheral eigenvalues of `T_{t₀}` are roots of unity (Thm 6.6)
2. These arise from generator eigenvalues `μ` with `Re(μ) = 0`, i.e., `μ = iθ`
3. For any `t > 0`, `exp(t·iθ)` is a peripheral eigenvalue of `T_t`
4. Since `T_t` is a channel, peripheral eigenvalues are roots of unity for every `t`
5. `exp(itθ)` root of unity for all `t > 0` forces `θ = 0`
   (`eq_zero_of_exp_mul_I_isRootOfUnity`)
6. Hence peripheral spectrum of `T_t` is `{1}`, i.e., `T_t` is primitive

  /- The full proof requires connecting:
     - Irreducibility of T_{t₀} to root-of-unity structure (Thm 6.6)
     - Spectral mapping between generator L and semigroup elements T_t
     - The number-theoretic argument that exp(itθ) root of unity ∀t ⟹ θ = 0
     Each piece is independently interesting; we defer the full assembly
     to future work when the spectral mapping infrastructure is complete. -/

/-- **Wolf Proposition 7.5** (full equivalence): For a QDS of channels, the
following are equivalent:
1. There exists `t₀ > 0` such that `T_{t₀}` is irreducible.
2. `T_t` is irreducible for all `t > 0`.
3. `T_t` is primitive for all `t > 0`.
4. There exists a positive definite `ρ_∞` such that `T_t(ρ) → ρ_∞` for all
   density matrices `ρ`.
5. `ker(L)` is one-dimensional and spanned by a positive definite `ρ_∞`. -/
