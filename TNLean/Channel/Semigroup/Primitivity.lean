# Irreducibility implies primitivity for quantum dynamical semigroups — Prop 7.5

## Main results

* `irreducible_semigroup_implies_primitive` — **Prop 7.5**:
  If `T_{t₀} = exp(t₀ · L)` is irreducible for some `t₀ > 0`, then
  `T_t` is primitive for ALL `t > 0`.

## Proof idea

If `T_{t₀}` is irreducible, then by Wolf Thm 6.6, its peripheral eigenvalues
`{λ₁, ..., λₘ}` are roots of unity. Consider `T_{π·t₀} = exp(π·t₀·L)`.
Its peripheral eigenvalues are `{λ₁^π, ..., λₘ^π}`. For irrational `π`,
`λᵢ^π` can only be a root of unity if `λᵢ = 1`. Since `T_{π·t₀}` is also
a channel (hence has peripheral eigenvalues that are roots of unity by
Thm 6.6), this forces `m = 1`, meaning `T_{t₀}` already has trivial
peripheral spectrum, hence is primitive.

/-! ## Channel semigroup definition -/

/-- A **quantum dynamical semigroup** (QDS) is a norm-continuous dynamical
semigroup where each `T_t` is a quantum channel (CPTP map) for `t ≥ 0`. -/

/-! ## Eigenvalue transfer between semigroup elements

If `λ` is an eigenvalue of `exp(t₀ · L)`, then `λ^(t/t₀)` is an eigenvalue
of `exp(t · L)`. This uses `spectrum.exp_mem_exp`. -/

/-- If `μ` is an eigenvalue of `L`, then `exp(t · μ)` is an eigenvalue of
`exp(t · L)` (spectral mapping theorem for exp). -/

/-! ## Prop 7.5: Irreducibility implies primitivity for QDS -/

/-- **Wolf Proposition 7.5** (1 → 3): If `T_{t₀}` is irreducible for some
`t₀ > 0`, then `T_t` is primitive for all `t > 0`.

The key insight is that peripheral eigenvalues of an irreducible channel
are roots of unity (Thm 6.6). Scaling time by an irrational factor shows
that the only root of unity that can survive is 1, hence the peripheral
spectrum is trivial, which is primitivity. -/

/-- **Wolf Proposition 7.5** (full equivalence): For a QDS of channels, the
following are equivalent:
1. There exists `t₀ > 0` such that `T_{t₀}` is irreducible.
2. `T_t` is irreducible for all `t > 0`.
3. `T_t` is primitive for all `t > 0`.
4. There exists a positive definite `ρ_∞` such that `T_t(ρ) → ρ_∞` for all
   density matrices `ρ`.
5. `ker(L)` is one-dimensional and spanned by a positive definite `ρ_∞`. -/
