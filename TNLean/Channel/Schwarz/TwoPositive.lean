# 2-Positive maps and the generalized Kadison–Schwarz inequality

This file defines **n-positive** and **2-positive** maps and proves that the
Kadison–Schwarz inequality holds for **unital 2-positive maps**, generalizing
the existing result which is restricted to completely positive maps.

## Main definitions

* `IsNPositiveMap` — a linear map `E` is n-positive if `E ⊗ id_n` is positive
* `Is2PositiveMap` — 2-positive maps (the case n = 2)

## Main results

* `IsCPMap.isNPositiveMap` — CP maps are n-positive for all n
* `IsCPMap.is2PositiveMap` — CP maps are 2-positive
* `kadison_schwarz_2positive` — Kadison–Schwarz for unital 2-positive maps

## Mathematical content

The hierarchy of positivity conditions is:

  positive ⊇ 2-positive ⊇ 3-positive ⊇ ⋯ ⊇ completely positive

The Kadison–Schwarz inequality `E(X†X) ≥ E(X)†E(X)` for **unital** maps
requires only **2-positivity**, not complete positivity. This was established
by Kadison (1952) and Choi (1974). The proof in `KadisonSchwarz.lean` already
uses only 2-positivity implicitly — it applies `E ⊗ id₂` to a 2×2 block
matrix — but the theorem is stated for CP maps via Kraus operators.

This file makes the 2-positivity hypothesis explicit.

## Strengthening relative to the literature

The existing `kadison_schwarz` in `KadisonSchwarz.lean` requires a Kraus
representation (complete positivity). The generalized version here applies
to the broader class of 2-positive maps, which includes some positive maps
that are not CP. For example, the transpose map on 2×2 matrices is positive
but not 2-positive, so it correctly fails the Kadison–Schwarz inequality.
The partial transpose on larger systems can be 2-positive without being CP.

/-- A linear map `E : M_n(ℂ) → M_n(ℂ)` is **k-positive** if the ampliation
`E ⊗ id_k : M_n(ℂ) ⊗ M_k(ℂ) → M_n(ℂ) ⊗ M_k(ℂ)` is a positive map.

We represent `M_n(ℂ) ⊗ M_k(ℂ)` as `M_{n×k}(ℂ)` via the Kronecker product
identification, and the ampliation acts blockwise:
`(E ⊗ id_k)(X)_{ij} = E(X_{ij})` for block indices `i, j ∈ Fin k`. -/

/-- A completely positive map is n-positive for every `n`.

This follows immediately from the definition: CP maps have Kraus representations,
and `E ⊗ id_k` applied to a PSD matrix yields a PSD matrix (by the same
Kraus-based argument as `IsCPMap.isPositiveMap`). -/

/-- **Kadison–Schwarz inequality for unital 2-positive maps.**

For any **unital 2-positive** map `E`, we have
`E(X† X) - E(X)† E(X) ≥ 0` (positive semidefinite).

This generalizes the existing `kadison_schwarz` (which requires a Kraus
representation, i.e., complete positivity) to the natural level of
generality: 2-positivity suffices.

**Proof sketch** (following Choi 1974): Apply `E ⊗ id₂` to the PSD block
matrix `P = [[X†X, X†], [X, I]]`, which is PSD as `P = v v†` with
`v = [X†, I]ᵀ`. Since `E ⊗ id₂` preserves PSD-ness (by 2-positivity), the
result `[[E(X†X), E(X†)], [E(X), E(I)]] = [[E(X†X), E(X)†], [E(X), I]]`
is PSD. The Schur complement of the (2,2)-block `I` gives the result.

This is exactly the same argument as in `KadisonSchwarz.lean`, but the
hypothesis is weakened from "Kraus representation exists" to "2-positive". -/

  -- Step 2: Apply E ⊗ id₂ (which preserves PSD-ness by 2-positivity).
  -- Step 3: The result is [[E(X†X), E(X)†], [E(X), I]] (using unitality for the (2,2) block).
  -- Step 4: Schur complement: E(X†X) - E(X)† · I⁻¹ · E(X) ≥ 0.

/-- The existing Kadison–Schwarz for Kraus maps is a corollary of the 2-positive
version, since CP maps are 2-positive.

This provides the logical connection: the existing concrete proof in
`KadisonSchwarz.lean` is a direct Kraus-based argument, while this
corollary shows it follows from the more general 2-positive result. -/
